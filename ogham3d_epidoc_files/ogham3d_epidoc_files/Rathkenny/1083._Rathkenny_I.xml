                    digitise and record in 3d as many as possible of the approximately four hundred surviving Ogham stones and to make
                    these 3D models freely available on the <orgName>Dublin Institute for Advanced
                        Studies</orgName> website as part of a multi-disciplinary archive of Ogham

                        This multivallate rath is situated on rising land and has an extensive view of the surrounding countryside.  
                        It consists of a circular area enclosed by three banks and fosses... In the SW sector of the interior are the remains of a souterrain. An opening 
                        was made into one of the chambers in the late 1970s, so the drystone walling construction of the chambers and tunnels is quite visible. As one enters, one sees 
                        an air vent, which leads through the earthen enclosing bank in the SW sector to its exterior side, thus providing fresh air to the chamber. A large ogham stone 
                        [Rathkenny I] is visible overhead. The centre chamber has much infill in it due to the way it was opened. To the left on entering there is a small narrow passage 
                        which leads to a chamber, sub-circular in plan and constructed in the beehive tradition. The lintel stone on the chamber side of the tunnel displayed ogham writing 
                        [Rathkenny III], but sadly it was removed without permission. To the right on entering there is another small tunnel which leads to a beehive chamber. The lintel 
                        stone on the tunnel side also displays ogham writing [Rathkenny II]. However, the chamber could not be investigated as it was too flooded to enter. It would appear 
                        that a tunnel leading to a fourth chamber and possibly others has now collapsed, but it would seem to have run roughly NE towards the interior of the fort</q>

                        discovered used as a lintel on the chamber side of the tunnel to the right, which had been flooded on previous visits <ref type="bibliog" target="#WHI2016"

                        without any difficulty and is followed by an M and one vowel score [not captured in the 3d model owing to the tightness of space]. The stone is embedded in masonry at this point but a further two vowel scores (they did not feel 
                        like H-series scores, i.e. MAQI) can be felt, suggesting that we have to do with an X MUCOI Y formula. On the southern angle, reading in the opposite direction, the 
                        letters I SAMM (or G?) NN can be read clearly and the final N appears to complete the inscription. Nothing can be seen before the I but it is possible, if not 
                        probable, that CO should be read here... With regard to the last name I cannot say whether [I]SAMMNN or [I]SAGNN was the intended reading, though the doubling of the M-series 
                        scores in the name of the commemorand suggests the former.</q> Further support for a double M rather than a G is the seemingly deliberate extra spacing between the single M scores (of both names) as 
                        opposed to the space between each two G scores in COMMAGGAGNI (see <ref type="bibliog" target="#MOF2011"

                        Alternatively, -AMMNN might be post-apocope form of -AMNI, compare CIIC 125. VALAMNI, in which case we would probably have 
                        to do with a compound name (leg. ISAMMNN = later Essomuin? [DIL: <hi rend="italic">es(s)amain (omun)</hi> 'fearless, bold, daring'])</q> <ref type="bibliog" target="#WHI2016"

                        For what it is worth, there is no space between the I and S. Spacing was evidently used to distinguish Ms and Gs in this inscription
                        but in general spacing between words in ogham, while frequently employed, was not consistent
