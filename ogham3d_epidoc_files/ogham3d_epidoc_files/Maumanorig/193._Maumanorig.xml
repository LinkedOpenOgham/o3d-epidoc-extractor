                    digitise and record in 3d as many as possible of the approximately four hundred surviving Ogham stones and to make
                    these 3D models freely available on the <orgName>Dublin Institute for Advanced
                        Studies</orgName> website as part of a multi-disciplinary archive of Ogham

                        It consists of a circular enclosure within which are the reputed site of a church, the foundations of a least 
                        two huts and a number of graves and gravemarkers which probably relate to the use of the site, until the 
                        19th century, as a calluragh burial ground (OSNB Marhin, 14). Also within the site are a cross-inscribed ogham 
                        stone, a small cross inscribed stone, a holed stone and 3 bullaun stones. Another cross-inscribed 
                        stone has been incorporated into the lane boundary wall on the N side of the field in which the enclosure is 
                        situated, and S of the enclosure is a holy well dedicated to St. Brendan</q>

                    <p><q>The intention of the stone-cutter was obviously to write                       
                        ANM COLMAN AILITHIR                        
                        `Name of Colman the Pilgrim'. But he has blundered so badly that he has made the decipherment 
                        of the inscription a very difficult matter. At best, the inscription is a `scholastic' essay.
                        
                        On the vertical part of the stem line he wrote ANM COL. He then realized that if he continued 
                        here he would have his N at the angle, and, consequently, awkwardly cramped; or else, if he 
                        carried on past the angle, it would run into the B-half of the M. Accordingly, he skipped the 
                        angle and wrote MAN on the horizontal branch of his stem-line. He then wrote AIL, the beginning 
                        of AILITHIR, before he saw that this word would have to be shortened to fit into the available 
                        space, which he had rashly reduced by cutting the second cross. A feeling of reverence may have 
                        prevented him from making room for himself by breaking this away. Accordingly, he squeezed an 
                        L into the space between the A and the I - its cramped nature is obvious - thus abolishing 
                        the first I of the word AILITHIR, and adapting the I which he had already fashioned to represent 
                        the second I of this word. He next had to dispose of the L which was already on the stone, and 
                        for which he would be obliged to substitute a T. This he ingeniously effected by cutting a line 
                        joining the distal ends of the two scores, thus turning these underline scores into overline 
                        scores, and then adding one more, and only one, in the orthodox position above the main stem-line. 
                        This gave him the three overline scores of the T. He then proceeded with the final IR, which just 
                        filled the available space, though it went beyond the range of the stem line which he had laid 
                        out at the beginning. In order to make his correction clear, he wrote in the turn of the angle 
                        of the stem line, which still remained blank, the letters O.L.Th - the Th being represented by 
                        the O-<hi rend="italic">forfid</hi> - meaning <hi rend="italic">ó L, Th-</hi> 'from L [make] Th'</q>
