Macalister/1928, 289, `The genitive case is so stereotyped, that the writers cannot accomodate themselves to the nominative which the construction requires.  Thus we get an inscription such as that at  Llaniltern, Glamorgan, where we read VENDUMAGLI HIC IACIT.  In fact, HIC IACIT can hardly be translated literally, `here lies'', at all; rather should we render it, as on certain ancient Scottish tombstones, THIS IS THE LAIR of So-and-so.''

Macalister, in Anon/1933, 362, `First, the parentage of the person commemorated is not recorded.  Such an omission presumably indicates that he was in his time a person of such importance that his name alone was enough to establish the ownership of the monument.  It is also possible that he was an ecclesiastic, who, so to speak, had renounced his earthly parentage and become a son of the Church.  In the Irish Annals the omission of the parentage, in referring to ecclesiastics, though not invariable, is the rule; but it is unusual in referring to laymen...Thirdly, as so often, we are confronted by the grammatical anomaly of constructing the genitive _Vendumagli_ with the verb _hic iacit_.  We may construe `The stone of Vendumaglos, here he lies'' or treating _hic-iacit_ as a sort of substantive,  `The `here-lieth'' of Vendumaglos.''   These expedients, however, are neither satisfactory nor necessary.  The use of the genitive is mere tradition, coming down from the earliest days of monumental epigraphy in these islands.  The _stone_ was not `Vendumaglos'' : it was the stone `of-Vendumaglos,'' and was soecified as such.  Before long, the external case-endings dropped out in pronounciation, and no difference was felt between the nominative and the genitive: compare modern Welsh,  where the distinction is expressed by nothing more than the relative position of the substantives.  Writers had a tradition that there ought to be an _i_ at the end of the word, which was not pronounced; they expressed this by writing it horizontally.  Most likely, at the comparatively late date when the engraver of this stone wrote `Venduumagli'', with the horizontal _i_ (probably not less than 300--400 years after the departure of the Romans), he did not realize that he was writing a genitive at all.  VENDVMAGL{I} was simply the conventional way of writing the name, and it represented a word which served for the nominative as well as the genitive, as the discriminating case-endings had ceased to be pronounced.''"|0|rcaps||"Westwood/1879, 7, `The inscription itself is 2 feet long and 1 foot wide, formed of two lines of rudely-shaped letters. It is to be read--- 

`VeNdVmAgl{I} hic IACIt 

`...the letters are large and coarsely cut, varying from 3 to 4 inches in height, and exhibit a curious mixture of capital, uncial, minuscule, and even cursive writing; the V, N, A, I, and C being capitals, the E and M uncials; the D, L, and H minuscules; and the G and T cursives.'' (See also Westwood/1871, 260.)

Macalister/1928, 292--293, `The process of supersession of the capitals by the minuscular script can be traced in some inscriptions which give us a mixed form of writing.  An excellent example is the Llaniltern inscription...This also illustrates the horizontal ``I'''' of the genitive termination.''

Macalister, in Anon/1933, 362, `Secondly, the inscription is palaeographically important.  It stands on the border-line between the earlier inscriptions in Roman capitals and the later inscriptions in minuscules: the two forms of the alphabet are mixed up together to a degree hardly to be paralleled elsewhere is Wales.''

Macalister/1949, 165, `The inscription is... in rather broad lines, semicircular in section.  It is in...mixed capitals and half-uncials''.

RCAHMW/1976, 38: `The letters combine Roman capitals with half-uncials (the latter being E, D, M, G, L, H, T), and also a horizontal terminal I at the end of the first line. The A-s both have an angular cross-bar as in No. 848, and the abnormal form of M can be paralleled (probably but not decisively) on two other inscriptions of roughly the same period, viz. E.C.M.

The A of ALADQ is likewise quite unjustifiable.  The two O''s, each of which had one admittedly faint notch, have been read as A''s ; the first I, which aadmittedly has rather long scores, trepassing unduly upon the H-surface, has been turned into Q; and the N has been inverted, likewise turning it into Q.

It is true that the part of this score below the line is worn, and almost indiscernable; but taking the five previous letters into combination, it is quite evident that the whole formed the Proper name, SAGROM. The eleveneth, to which he also gives the value of H, is undeniably an M, the score crossing the line or angle.  This, with the three following letters, form the word MAQI.  The fifteenth character is an M, the lower half of which is defaced.  That such is its value there can be no doubt, as the following four letters, with it, form a word so remarkable, and so often found in these inscriptions, the word MUCOI. ...''

Jones in his account of it published in the Archaeologia Cambrensis, 1860, p. 314. This figure was made after repeated examinations of the stone by Mr. Jones, and my own sketch of the stone and its Oghams agrees with that of Mr. Jones. There are, however, several difficulties in deciphering these Oghams which led Mr. Jones to defer attempting a reading of them. The late Mr. R. R. Brash, M.R.I.A., visited the stone in 1870, and published a memoir on it in Arch. Camb., 1872, p. 24. He considers that the difficulty pointed out by Mr. Jones, arising from the prolongation of some of the upper and crossing consonants to an angular projection on the eastern side of the stone, giving some countenance to the idea of a second line of inscription, does not in reality exist, and that there is no second line of inscription intended ; indeed, had a continuation of the main line of Oghams been required, it would as usual have been carried on to the north-west or right-hand angle of the stone. The Oghams occupy 5 feet 3 inches of the north-east angle ...

`Dr. Samuel Ferguson (Proc. Royal Irish Acad., vol. xi. p. 48) reads the Oghams as NETTASACHROHOCOUDOCOEFFECI, i. e. `Netta Sagro hoc or Sagromoc oudoco effeci,'' there having been a Bishop Oudoc of Llandaff in the seventh century ; which reading is controverted by Mr. Brash (loc. cit. supra) at great length.

`In a subsequent note (Arch. Camb., 1872, p. 355, and see Arch. Camb., 1874, p. 92) Dr. Ferguson partly admits the incorrectness of his reading, especially as regards the Oudoc part of the inscription as pointed out by Mr. Brash, but adduces other peculiarities in support of other portions of his reading. To these again Mr. Brash replied in Arch. Camb., 1873, pp. 103, 285, especially insisting on the prefix Nec instead of Netta. 

`Prof. Rhys (Arch. Camb., 1873, pp. 76, 197, 386, and 1874, p. 90) adopts the reading of the Oghams-

And I should have said that the other N is considerably wider than the first.  There is a difficulty, however, about the reading of the wider N, for the first part of the letter is not clear, owing to the stone being uneven at that point and slightly damaged, probably when it was recently removed to where it is.  There is another imperfect letter, namely the last in the first line.  It is here represented provisionally as an I, but that is not the reading, as it has a line at right angles to it suggesting the lower bar of an F, but the top is gone it might just as well be the first portion of a P, or even of an A, excepting that one would hardly expect the first limb of an A to be perpendicular, which is the case here.  Unfortunately, the epitaph supplies no A for one to compare, but instances undoubtedly occur of the letter A having its first limb perpendicular or very nearly so.  Whatever the imperfect letter was, I see no possibility of reading it as an S of any kind, though that would have completed the word _filius_ and spared us some serious difficulties, among them that of fixing how many letters followed, if any, and which they were.  At all events I think that the inscriber must have tried to finish the word following FILI on the edge, so that he cannot have had many letters to write there. ...

Forsyth notes the presence of a number of unusual characters and_forfeda_. These are: 
Character 3: `After a gap there are two short strokes to the right of the stem, sloping forwards. Macalister interpreted these as L without any further comment. The lack of a bind-stroke renders this unlikely but in any case it is clear that the second stroke, at least, continues across the stem. There is a nick at the point where the right distal end of the first stroke would lie, but no evidence of anything between that and the stem.Padel interpreted these as two seperate letters, BM, but was unhappy that they were so cramped. Neither mentions what appears to be a third stroke, sloping in the opposite direction, most obvious to the right of the stem, but continuing across to intersect with the second stroke just to the left of the stem....I think it is unlikely that there is more than a single letter here. That the first stroke is not bound to the second throws it into some doubt, since all the other letters are bound. The third stroke is doubtful, but if accepted could be intended for the first _forfid_ ><. that the two opposing diagonals do not intersect exactly on the stem would be explained as just a careless slip caused by carving the letters first and then adding the stem to join them up...One might speculate that the reason this letter is so indistinct is because it was a botched job deliberately effaced by the carver but really this is clutching at straws...

Character 7: `A single stroke perpendicular across the stem with a bind stroke on the right distal end- a hammer-head A''.

Character 10: `Next is a very worn patch out of which emerge the distal ends  of three strokes to the right and three to the left. These slope in the direction of the reading and if produce would meet the stem to form three right-facing arrows...each slightly larger than the previous one.  The lack of bind strokes is surprising, but nonetheless this group is probably best interpreted as an angled vowel - U''. 

Character 16: `One long stroke perpendicularly across the stem intersected by a second lying at an angle of less than 45 degrees to the stem. The perpendicular stroke is deeper than the oblique one. This has been interpreted as the first _forfid_ >< and assigned a value K by Padel. It is, howevere, quite unlike [character] 21 which is formed, not of straight intersecting lines, but of opposed angled  lines which do not quite meet''. 

Character 21: `Two long angled strokes, opposing, not meeting ><...This same character appears on the Formaston [FRMSN] and Lunnasting [LTING] stones but it is unclear whether it is to be considered a variant of the first _forfid_ or a separate character in its own right''. 

Character 22: `Cross-hatching - two superimposed sets of five parallel oblique strokes across the stem in opposite directions. This _forfid_ is known from the manuscript tradition and is found in stone at Bressay. It has the value RR [Sims-Williams 1992: 72]. it is unclear if there is any difference in the sound represented by this character as opposed to the moe usual pair of Rs, e.g., 5/6, 11/12''.

Westwood/1879, 107, `Notwithstanding the conjunction `Et'' at the commencement of the inscription, which might be supposed to indicate it to be the continuation of a paragraph commenced on the other side of the stone, I am inclined to think, from the evident faults both grammatical and orthographical in the inscription, that we have before us the whole, and that the meaning of the introductory formula is an entreaty, to all passers-by, in the name both (et) of the Cross itself and of Him who was fixed thereon, to pray for the soul of Catuoconus. The word `fingsi'' (finxi), it is true, might be supposed to allude to a figure of the Saviour sculptured on the cross, as in one or two rare instances in other parts of Wales, as at Llangan, but this stone bears the plain cross, and cannot therefore be supposed to have been surmounted by a sculptured crucifix. We have before us also a very early instance of the supplication of prayers for the soul of the deceased, and the word employed for that purpose, `exorent,'' is a very unusual one in these Welsh inscriptions. This branch of the subject offers interesting material for enquiry in connexion with the question of the age of the inscription itself.''  (Repeated from Westwood/1855b.)

Macalister/1945, 406--409, ` But the sense of the inscription, owing to its illiterate Latinity, is not easy to grasp, and calls for more detailed discussion than the rest.

`The latter part, from _rogo_ onward, is fairly easy, the only difficulty being the sense ascribed to _ibi_.  Is it a mistake for _hic_, ``here?''''  Or does it mean what it says, ``there?''''  Remebering that the stone came from an island, within sight of the mainland, we can understand how to the dwellers on the island, ``there'''' would become a natural expression for ``the mainland.'''' ... one who wished for prayers might well express the hope that all those who came on pilgrimage to the island, and who returning ``walked over there'''' (as he expressed it in bad Latin), should not forget him : and, moreover, that they should carry out the duty _fervently_, which presumably what he meant by _ex-orent_.

`As to _singno crucis in illam fingsi_, we must understand _illam_ as referring to the stone, and may explain its feminity by remembering that in Welsh, the language in which the writer was doubtless thinking, _llech_ is feminine.  _Singno_, in which the attraction of the legitmate _n_ has nasalized the preceding _g_, may be interpreted in one of three ways: ``By the sign of the cross which I have fashioned, I pray''''---a formula of adjuration ; as an ablative: ``With the sign of the cross I have'''' decorated it ; or as a mistake for the accusative : ``I  have fashioned the sign of the cross upon it.''''  The last is preferable as the simplest of the three possibilities: and the standard of Latinity which it assumes is not too low for our author.

`What then, of _et_?  It implies that something has gone before L but it certainly does not link on to the Ogham, with which it has nothing whatever to do.  Rather does it appear to link link to the _destruction_ of the Ogham.  We may picture the writer as a hermit on the island, occupying an anchorite cell which preceded the twelfth-century priory.  He discovered, and so far as he could, destroyed the heathenish monument, left behind by some Goidel to pollute the sacred island.  Before doing so he ``disharmed'''' the paganism of the Ogham by surrounding it with crosses on all sides, as his fellow-anchorites did on Inchgoill ... If the space on the 
stone had permitted, and if his Latinity had been equal to the strain, what he would have said would have said would have been something like this: ``[See, I have purged this stone of 
heathenism], and have fashioned the sign of the cross upon it.  I pray to all who return from to the mainland to make fervent prayer for the soul oof me, Catuoconus.''''  By this interpretation, the inscription is not the memorial of a dead Catuoconus, but of a Catuoconus no doubt well meaning, but from the standpoint of an epigraphist rather too much alive.

`In a previous publication I suggested that the inscription made a triad of three metrical lines rhyming in -i ... I was inclined afterwards to doubt whether the writer''s scholarship was equal to 
such a _tour-de-force_, but Prof. I. Williams has assured me that he feels no such uncertainty.''

Nash-Williams/1950, 182: `Animae (Ablative), if not accidental, shows the substitution of _ae_ for _a_ occasionally met with in early inscriptions.   The form _singno_ (for _signo_) probably follows contemporary pronunciation. ... The formula used in the epitaph is akin in type to that employed on No. 125.''"|0|rbook||"Westwood/1879, 107--108, `Although offering a certain amount of regularity to the eye, the letters themselves of the inscription are for the most part rudely formed, and about 2 1/2 inches in height, with very little space left between the lines. ... 

`With the exception of the simply-formed I, C, R (in the first line only), O and F, which are Roman capitals (and even of these, the lower oblique right-hand stroke of the R not carried down to the line, and the upper cross-stroke of the F forming an angle at its origin with the top of the upright stroke, indicate an approach to the minuscule forms of these two letters), the whole of the inscription is in that curious mixture of minuscule and uncial letters transformed into capitals which became general soon after the departure of the Romans, and which is found in all the oldest inscriptions and manuscripts both in Great Britain and Ireland. The conjoined et (&) in the first line and cx in the sixth line are especially interesting from their agreement with such ancient documents ; the a like two C''s conjoined together, the b slightly variable in form and sometimes scarcely distinguishable from the g, the best formed one being in the fourth line ; the e like a c, with a central cross bar free at its extremity ; the F almost F-shaped, and not carried below the line ; the g especially remarkable, particularly in the first line, where it is reduced in size from the proximity of the foot of the cross ; the l formed like a L, with the angle rounded off and the top of the first stroke inclined to the left, although in the fifth line it almost looks like a c ; the m invariably m-shaped ; the n either like a capital N but with the oblique stroke reversed, or like a H ; the p P-shaped, and not carried below the line ; the R either R-shaped or like a cursive n, with the second stroke carried down obliquely nearly to the bottom of the line ; the s f-shaped, but not carried above the line ; the t like a c with a tranverse bar at the top, and the u invariably u-shaped. All these peculiarities indicate the occurrence of a period between the departure of the Romans and the time when this stone was sculptured. But I think, from a comparison of this inscription with other early monuments, both lapidary and manuscript, in England, Wales, and Ireland, that we cannot err in affixing to it the date given above.

Camb._ 1939: 13) and compared it with my own photograph.  This drawing revealed to me the last letter as an ill drawn N, which I had never been able to trace to my own satisfaction till then.  The scribe must have been given a model on a writing tablet set out thus:

`Then by some mental confusion he mistook the EUT for an ET which he ought to have written, and proceeded to write the RE following.

The last three letters he filled in where he could, the C in the blank before the ETT, the EN in the blank after it.  The N in the model must have been composed of two minims, concave in opposite senses [thus, )( ] ; and the scribe brought them into contact back to back, turning the letter into an X, adding, as a freak of his own, a wavy line below, to decorate it with a serpentine flourish. ...

That at the N.W. end of this line has _certainly_ been inscribed, on the two angles of the southern face... The stone has suffered severely from weather and cattle  wear, and I should not now commit myself to the reading above suggested, or, indeed, to any other.

On the sinister angle, the five bold notches observed by Brash are amongst the clearest Ogham marks that I have seen anywhere: they run between 7'" and 1'' 6'" down from the top of the stone, and now appear to me to be followed by a C.

`The letters are for the most part tolerably good Roman capitals. The G in the top line is however of the uncial form, and the L at the beginning of the second line is unusual, from having the bottom angle rounded so as to resemble an upright minuscule l.
 
`It has subsequently suggested itself to my mind that the commencement of the second line has, like part of the ornamental work, been chiselled away, and that the LI are portions of the word FILI, leaving the remainder, VENDONI, as the proper name of the father of the person commemorated. A repeated examination of my rubbings (confirmed by a visit to the stone in July, 1877) shows an oblique stroke on the right side of the first letter of the upper line, which I had thought might be a P, making it a R, as has been suggested by Prof. Rhys (Arch. Camb., 1874, p. 332), who further suggests that the first name seems to be RUGNIAVTO, with the top of the T very faint, but he does not think it can be Rugniavio. The stone is however so imperfect in this part that only guesses can be made as to its true reading. I cannot however believe the two marks following the A (the second of which is upright) to be intended for u, because that letter is clearly made of the v form in both rows of letters.''

`They are situate on the top of the stone, where there is a considerable fracture or flake off at the angle, consequently the inscription is imperfect. The diagonal direction of some of the scores of the first two characters have been remarked on, but there is nothing peculiar in it beyond some freak or inadvertence in the engraving, as I have seen them similarly marked on other monuments. The second inscription on the right angle is as follows :---     [figure]

`H Q D  A H C D NG G O A 

`From the long spaces between several of the characters it is quite evident that this inscription is imperfect; that several of the letters have been obliterated, principally vowels, which being usually small circular or oval dots on the angle are generally the first to be defaced either by violence or weather. From the skeleton of the Ogham which remains, it is, however, quite evident that this is not a bilingual inscription, as any filling-up of the missing letters could not produce the equivalent of the Roman inscription. It is also worthy of remark in this, as in all similar cases, that the inscriptions are always reverse, the Roman reading from top to bottom, the Ogham from bottom to top. It is therefore evident that they are by different hands and of different dates. To my mind, the evidence of this worn and mutilated Ogham pillar-stone is that it was appropriated as the monument of a Romanised Briton after having long performed a similar office for some invading Gaedhal.''

Anon/1869, 444, `But the most singular circumstance is, that in addition to the Roman inscription there is one of well defined Ogham characters.  It has not, however (as far as ascertained), been translated.''

Westwood/1879, 20--21, `In the small figure and description of this stone which I published in the Archaeologia Cambrensis, 1846, p. 182, I directed attention to the small incised strokes in groups along the two edges of the front of the stone, those on the left side near the top being three parallel, three radiating,[2] and three radiating, and the groups on the right angle from the top having respectively 2, 5, 2, 5, 5, and 5 strokes. These I had no hesitation in regarding as Oghams. A more careful examination which I subsequently made of the stone, verified by additional rubbings, proved that I had overlooked some strokes, as seen in the result of this examination given in Pl. XII ; although, from the evanescent character of many of the strokes by time and ill-usage, it is possible that I have still overlooked some of these marks; indeed, Mr. R. R. Brash, in an article `On the Ogham inscribed Stones of Wales'' (Arch. Cambr. 1869, pp. 148--167), thus describes and figures these Oghams :---  [Here Westwood quotes Brash given above] ...

`Mr. Rhys (`The Early Inscribed Stones of Wales,'' p. 8). speaking of this stone, adopts a very different and ingenious reading of the Oghams :---`The Celtic characters are very hard to read, owing to their having been extensively worn off. With great deference to archaeologists, I venture to suggest that the following letters are to be traced on the stone : Pompei...oral...smeq . ll . n. The first part of this would be Pompei Carantoral, and the termination al would be our adjectival _-ol_ or _awl_, rendering the Latin _ius_ of Carantorius. Here a character something like the Eisteddfodic  [fig /|\] was extemporised to represent _p_, and when the scribe, if we may so term him, came to make _m_, that was done by making a long stroke across the angle of the stone as usual, but instead of making /|\ for _p_ in this instance, he left out the first line of it and placed the other two lines to lean against the _m_, thus forming a conjoint character for _mp_ which greatly puzzled me.''

`[2] The three radiating lines have much puzzled subsequent writers. Mr. Wendele (Arch. Camb. 1846, p. 413) compared them to the _bird''s-claw Ogham_ of Killarney, whilst the Rev. John Williams (ibid. p.415), with reference to the supposed Bardic alphabet, gives a legend of Einigan Gawr (the giant) and his three pillars of light, adding, `The Bardic symbol is formed of three radiating lines [fig], which it is said are intended to represent the three diverging rays of light which Einigan saw, and it is remarkable that these three lines contain all the elements of the Bardic alphabet, as there is not a single letter in it that is not formed of some of these lines. Now are those scores on the left angle of the Kenfegge stone, Glamorganshire. the last and most genuine home of Bardo-Druidism, anything more than representations of the Bardic symbol? ...

It simply contains two names; the Roman name POMPEIUS, spelt with a _u_ instead of an _o_, and another name, which later appears in the form _Cerentirus_ in the _Book of Llan Dav_---incidentally indicating by the vowel-changes that the name was accented on the penultimate syllable.

`It may be questioned whether in PVMPEIVS CARANTORIVS we have the epitaph of one person or two.  Two names in the nominative, unconnected by any indication of relationship, meet us again at Llanddewi Brefi, in the inscription DALLVS DUMELVS.  At Llangwarren, Pembrokeshire, there are two names similarly independent of one another, TEGERNACI DOBAGNI; and here again, one of those names is echoed in the associated Ogham, but not the other.  The lettering on the Langwarren stone seems to indicate that the two names were cut by different hands, and presumably at different times, pointing to the conclusion that in that case two persons, perhaps two brothers, are commemorated.  But neither the Llandewi Brefi nor the Kenfig inscriptions show any such want of uniformity in the lettering.  The question may be left unanswered.''

Macalister/1945, 387, `That these two names in the nominative case represent two persons is suggested by the rendering of one of them in the Ogham''.

Westwood/1879, 19--20: `Roman characters, PVMPEIVS CARANTORIVS; the only doubt being as to whether the second and third letters of the top line, which are conjoined, should be VM or VN. I prefer the former reading, because if read VN the N would be reversed, whereas it is of the proper form in the second line ; whilst the transformation of the second stroke of the V into the first stroke of a conjoined M is of common occurrence. The letters were also read as VM in Camden, as mentioned below...The Welsh Britans (as the Right Reverend the Bishop of Landaff who sent me the copy [of this inscription] informed me),'' says Camden, `by adding and changing some letters thus read and make this interpretatio : _Pim bis an ear Antopius_ [given in Gough''s Camden _Purnpbus ear a''n lopius_], i.e. The five fingers of friends or neighbours killed us.'' Holland''s Camden, 1610, p. 645.

` ...As for the word Pumpeius for Pompeius, we have already observed (Lhwyd, Arch. Britan. vol. i. p. 17, col. 2) that in old inscriptions the letter V is frequently used for O [Gibson''s Camden ii, p. 23]''.

Rhys/1899, 132--133, `That is to say, Pumpeius (more usually Pompeius) Carantorius. The first letters, P and C, have been considerably damaged, probably by boys throwing stones at the old monument, for it stands unprotected by the, road-side. The VN seem to form a conjoint character for VM, though they can hardly be said to be completely joined, but no more are the two limbs of the V; otherwise we should have to read V and {N} (or N reversed). The P has a rather small top: the E is of the rounded minuscule kind, and the S in both instances is well developed somewhat below the line of the other letters. The first A shows a bulging out at the ends of the horizontal bar, while the other A is more regular and somewhat broader at the top. The N is rather straggling and carelessly formed, while the tail of the H in both instances tends to be horizontal. Lastly, the O is circular, and, as frequently happens, it is rather smaller than the other letters.''

The 5th is probably a cramped _C_, four leftward grooves, of which only the first and fourth are plain; their spacing, and faint surface traces, suggest their were two more grooves between them.  For the 8th, surface traces suggest the two notches of _O_. Analogy with the other Welsh Ogham stones requires a genitive termination, and it cannot be the commonest such termination _I_ (five notches) or _AS_ (a notch and four rightward grooves).  This confirms _O_, which occurs as the genitive termination of Goidelic nouns whose nominative ends in _-is_ or _-us_.  The inscription thus reads: `(Stone) of Taricoris (or -us)'.  _Tar-_ is a common constituent of Celtic personal names, but this example seems to be elsewhere unattested.'|ABHYD/1/2
BAHAN|2|1|f|f|poor|"Macalister/1945, 94--95: `...it is in poor condition, especially the second line, which is chipped...The inscribed angles run round the circumference of the stone clockwise, not counter-clockwise, which is more usual. The name CORBAGNI occupies the first angle. Here the O is broken off, the proximal ends of the B-half of the R scores are spalled away; and N 2 is likewise injured. On the second angle [KOI MAQI MOC], the K, here represented by the >< variety of  the _forfid_ sign, is clear, but is followed by a long stretch of angle, which seems to have been cut away with intention. It is far too long for the OI which we should expect: to show this clearly, the letters OI have been written on the diagram, with interspaces proportioned to those in the rest of the inscription. Along this cutting the H-surface is spalled: but about the middle of the spalled surface there appear the distal ends of three scores, diverging outward, _cut_ in fine lines, contrasting notably with the coarse pocking of the rest of the inscription. This seems to imply interference with the inscription by later hand (still ancient, however, as the cutting, and its subsequent injury, must have taken place before the concealment of the stone in the souterrain). An _upright_ feather-mark has no place in the orthodox Ogham alphabet: but it appears in the _Book of Ballymote_ Ogham tract (facs. p. 312, line 13) among a series of '"sigla'" or monograms, as one of four variant characters for '"P or UI'". Evidently the character is treated as a  monogram of VI; and we may provisionally accept the transliteration suggested, and interpret the combination as KUI (=KOI). It is reasonable to attribute this alteration to some pedant; but his interference is of importance as it adds to the accumulating evidence that the _Book of Ballymote_ variations on the ogham theme are not mere _nugae monachorum_, as has been too hastily supposed, but genuine collections of cryptographic devices...This leaves unexplained the gap which must have existed in the inscription, in its original form, between OI and the following M - a gap wide enough to hold five scores. Such gaps are rare, but not unknown. Here, conceivably, the KOI was an afterthought, the inscription on the second angle having begun with MAQI; And the lapidary who inserted it, whether the original artificer or another, having begun too low down on the angle, left himself with an excess of room. This adds a slight confirmation to the conclusion indicated above [Macalister/1945, ix] that the word KOI was something more than a mere demonstrative particle pointing to the _stone_: out of regard for the honour of the owner of the monument it was worth the while of a hostile hand to take the trouble to efface it. The engraver, having written MOC on the shoulder of his second angle, passed over the very rough top of the stone, and finished on the third angle; inadvertently (?) doubling the C. The first score of the second C has been cut out of the stone, just as has happened to the vowels on the second angle. The following OI is faint, and the initial C of the next word is battered; but with a little trouble all these letters, as well as the rest of the inscription, can be read''.

This may possibly be Greater Asclepiad, but I regard it rather as an instance of the Archilochian verse as in the case of the Llanerfyl stone:--

`Sena | cus presby | ter hic | iacit cum | multi | tudne | fratrum

`But even that is not right, since there ought to be a break at the end of the tetrameter, and it is not unlikely that _multitudine_ was intended as a trisyllable.  In that case the verse would run thus:

Macalister''s reading in 1945 is significantly more cautious than that of 1919.

    This inscription is desolate. As against Macalister''s reading, nothing can be made out of the first two letters of his first `MAQ''. At the bottom of the inscribed edge, five scores can be recognized that may represent Macalister''s second Q. Equally, of his `ACTO'' only the last vowel notch can be made probable. In the middle, it is not easy to verify Macalister''s MAQ; at least, the distance between the M score and what would have to be regarded as the A dot would be extremely short; the same holds true for the first Q score (cp. figs. 7 and 3). In the upper third of the inscription, Macalister''s G cannot be verified; there seems to be just one M score. - There is no indication whatsoever in favour of Macalister''s supposition that the peculiar shape of the stone might be due to a `MAQI MUCOI'' formula having been intentionally destroyed''.

The surface of the stone being in his judgement too small to hold the inscription in a continuous line, and the craftsman too inexperienced to use the edge as a stem-line, he divided it into two, indicating the '"join'" by star-like marks. 
    The feather-mark, found commonly in Ogham scribbles in manuscripts, was doubtless used when brief communications were made upon waxed tablets or strips of vellum, to avoid the errors latent in this ambiguous script. Without some such indication of the beginning of the writing, the recipient had no guide as to which was the top of the bottom of the line. The mark appears here; as it is in the middle of the line, not at the end, the model must have been cut, not on a rod, but on a ring of wood: the lapidary did not even understand its function. Such rings of wood were not improbably often suspended from stones which now bear no inscriptions: they would be more easily cut than the stone, and would at least outlast a generation. 
   The inscription is apparently further complicated by the interspersed long strokes, apparently intended to differentiate the separate letters. These may be quite otiose; or they may be exaggerations of the _last_ score of the preceding letter. The latter is, perhaps, the more probable, as the result of ignoring the long scores gives us the meaningless _obudboldse_ (we must read retroversely from the feather-mark, as otherwise we should be embarrassed by the presence of the carefully-avoided letter H)...there are such endless possibilities of miscut or misplaced scores, that to try to restore what the lapidary was actually commissioned to write is perfectly hopeless''.

Rhys revisited the stone in 1896, and changed his mind as to how the stone was to be read stating:   `I am now inclined to agree with him [Lewis---see Owen/1896, 138] as to the first two lines...I think I now understand how one read ANVS.  The A had a broad top A, and to its top is joined a V, and this makes a conjoint AN, which owing to the ample top of the A suggested to me the F of FILIVS; but I feel positive now that one cannot read FILIVS without reading the V part of the N as L, and supplying an I to make the IVS---both impossible, as I satisfied myself the other day. ...I cannot read the third line as SACRI, but rather as SACER, with the C and the E ligatured.  I do not, however, feel very certain about this, but the next line ends with an unmistakeable S; and had I no regard for the probabilities of the case I should read the last line INS.  But if SACER is correct, one would expect the next line to be DVS...In fact, D [reversed] VS, with the D facing the other way, is a possible reading'' (Rhys/1897, 140--142).

In the second line a very faint suggestion of a horizontal line after the I is visible in some lights; it may be natural, but it would account for the various readings with A at the beginning of this line.  ...The fourth line is the only one which involves any serious uncertainty.  A piece of stone has flaked away from the centre of the line, removing one or more letters, and damaging the last.  The line has been read D[O]S, but the first letter seems to be an undamaged I, without any trace of the loop of a D.  In the photograph it appears to be followed by a bar and second upright as if an H, but the upright is in fact due to flaking. The bar, although it can scarely be felt, compares with that faintly visible between the I and N of the second line, and suggests that this line too began I--N.  All that survives of the last letter of the line is a complete loop, which could be the upper part of either an S, or more probably of a P; the lower part is destroyed.

Mr. Robinson considers there are five, these representing the letter T, whilst Mr. Romilly Allen''s sketch gives only one, representing A; and in my grass-rubbing there is a space of 9 inches, with indications of three oval impressions, leaving spaces for two others, which are not, however, defined''.

Rhys/1895a, 185: `Below _Quegte_ a considerable flake of the edge of the stone has been some time or other hammered off the stone; in fact the points at which the stone was struck are to be detected, four or five of them, but the flake has left the further or upper portions of the five scores for the ||||| of _maqui_, remaining, and I have no doubt that one may venture to consider that the whole inscription originally read as follows...I have to remark that the final _e_ is certain, while as to the other _e_ there is some difficulty, as one finds a good sized notch immediately after the _Qu_, while the remaining three depressions are smaller, and possibly not part of the reading at all.  In that case one would have to read _Quagte_ perhaps; but I think the reading _Quegte_ is much more probable.''

Rhys later revisited the stone and revised the above opinions, stating: `I am now very much in favour of _Quagte_, and inclined to regard the three depressions as accidental, and the cause of the inscriber skipping the space taken up by them'' (Rhys/1896, 103--104).

Macalister/1945,  401: `Between the Q''s there is space for five or six scores, which can have been only vowels or B-scores. The angle is not badly injured as to prevent the survival of possible traces of vowels, but there is nothing of the kind.  Before the first Q are the marks read M A by Rhys (top half of M only).  They are not nearly so definite as the Q and I take them to be illusory. There are other illusory scores on the face to the left of the inscribed angle, and also on the angle to the left of that again. After the second Q there is one vowel notch, followed by a space of 3 1/2'" in which nothing can be found but three little nicks. These are hardly to be taken with the genuine notch to make E.  There is also a sloping scratch, close to and parallel with the following G-scores, not noticed by Rhys: it is equally out of the question to associate this with the G and to make NG out of them.  The final vowel is certainly E, not I''."|BRAW1/1/1

First, a group of five straight stokes to the left (N), occupying 5 inches  ; then an apparently blank space of seven inches, in which are several irregular impressions which can scarcely be intended for letters, so that the continuity of the writing seems to be doubtful in this part of the stone.  Above this space is another group of five strokes to the left (N), occupying 4 1/2 inches.  Then follows another space of 5 inches, in which are three or four uncertain equal sized impressions (U or E), of which the lowest is the largest.  Then follow two long oblique strokes extended to the right, the first forked at its right end, with a third more indistinct line, if indeed it be more than a dot (GO or NG).  These strokes occupy 3 inches, and are succeeded by three short lines to the left (F, 3 inches), followed by a space of 2 inches, in which is a dot (A), and ending at top with four stright lines to the right (C, 3 inches).

`The uncertainty in deciphering this  inscription arises chiefly from the blank spaces, which appear destitute of decided letter markings.

Mr. Harries, noticing this, told me that he had dectected letters there one day as he was passing by on horseback, when the sun was shining right on the stone.  I seemed to find there traces of two lines running parallel with the edge, and in the direction contrary to the Ogam, which is _en regle_.  The outer line seemed to me to end with N --- minus the second upright of the N, which I  could not detect.  If my guess prove well founded, it should be the end of the name _Vendogni_, which probably constituted the whole of the line.  Of the second line I thought I identified IL or LI, which I took to be remains of the word FILI.  But as it was raining torrents during most of the time of my  inspection, I am by no means satisfied that more cannot be made out when the weather is more favourable and the sun is shining. ...

Macalister/1945, 399: `He [Rhys] describes it as being in two lines ; it is, however, in three.

In line 1 the G is quite clear, as is also the O in line 2, just below it ; the tail of the G and the make a ``figure-of-8,'''' which the reader''s eye should catch first.  The I''s concluding wach line are also clear.  Having fixed G and I in line 1, the N between them can be traced with no great difficulty ; and then, working backwards from the G, we encounter  in turn O, D, N, E, but not the initial U, which has disappeared absolutely.  In line 2, between the O and the I, already fixed, there traces that look like C ; before the O there is an appearance of a much-battered H ; before that again are leics of ILI, but none of F.  The DEGNI which forms line 3, can be traced, but doubtfully, by standing where the light can be seen to strike obliquely on the stone---a midnight visit with a strong electric torch might possibly make the letters more certainly legible.  The porch where the stone lies is small and cramped, and it is difficult to find a suitbale view-point.    Lhuyd found the stone already in use as a footbridge : his drawing gives UENDAGNI as the first line, and FILIU* *NI as the second, the asterisks have representing nondescript letters of which the first might by [sic.] SP or R, and the second some form of G.

`BRIACI FILI
`GLVVOCC{I}

`not EVOLENGG{I}---, which I was totally unable to verify.''

Macalister/1945, 402: `Line 1 is certain, notwithstanding some injury by flaking.  The FI is kigatured.  Just in front of the middle B there is a small triangular mark like the head of an A, and about 1 1/2'" before that again there is a short sloping scratch.  These marks are not intentional any more than a well-defined score on the right-hand edge, 5'" above the B, which looks like a Ogham digit, but really is the edge of a spall-matrix.  Equally illusory are some vague marks near the head of the stone, which an imaginative observer might turn into the final vowel of _Briaci_, and the beginning of _Maqi_.  There is actually no Ogham on the stone :  I mention them merely to show that I have not overlooked them.

`Line 2 is much injured.  Beneath the B of line 1 there is a much battered sickle-shaped G.  Then comes a spalled surface, from the top of which the summit of an upright line projects, most likely belonging to an L.  Then comes V, uninjured and certain, and the dexter half of a second V.  The sinister half is reduced to the edge of a flake matrix, within the area of which the outlines of O C can be faintly traced.  Then comes the top of another C, and the final I.  There is a sloping mark, not I think, part of the inscription, but which if prolonged, would turn the second of these C''s into another sickle-shaped G, and as such it is represented in Rhys''s diagram ; but his restoration, [E] V[OLEN]G{I}, is hardly borne out, either by the existing remains or by the blank spaces.  In AC 1896, p. 302, BRIACI is misprinted BRINACI.  We have already seen the name GLUVOCCI (with one C) at Ystradfellte (345) and we shall meet with BRIACI at Bridell (426).''

Character _Right 4_:...this is probably not a _forfid_ but rather a corrected error in carving...

Character _ Right 20. 21_ : This rabbit-eared character is unique to Bressay. Since it consists of two strokes to the left of the stem previous authorities have taken it as some kind of modified D, presumably the voiced spirant...This seems by far the most likely explanation (and if it is not we can only guess at this character''s value), but implies a breakdown in the old convention DD for /d/, D for [voiced aspirant] /d/ (presumably the initial D in the following word has the value /d/ because of the practice of avoiding geminate consonant symbols in word-initial position [Harvey 1987]).

Character _Right 28_:...Angled vowels...may indicate long vowels. Whatever its value, we may take it as some form of A, contrasting with the standard A-character occurring  in the previous two words (_10, 18, 23_). 

Character _Left  5_: ...This unique character , five undulating strokes sloping backwards across the stem is presumably a vowel, since it occurs between the second and the third of a group of three Ns. As a five-stoke vowel we may take it as some from of I, rather than R. Angled-stroke I...does not occur at Bressay, but since angle-stroke A does, we may have warrant for rejecting /f/ as the value of this character. Though it is really rather different from them, it may be useful to compare instances elsewhere in Scottish oghams of cross-strokes with flaps, e.g. Birsay 1-2 [BIRSY /1, BIRSY/2], Latheron [LARON], Lochgoilhead [LOHED/1, LOHED/2], though most of these face in the opposite direction. 

Character _Left 15_: A character consisting of _four_stroke cross-hatching..appears in the late eighth or ninth-century Bern ogham alphabet  and syllabary under a label which has previously been read as RR. Sims-Williams has argued convincingly that instead ths is SS (1992:38--39, fig. 5), but rather than remove the manuscript key to the Bressay character''s value, he has in fact demonstrated the precedent (with the letters BB and LL) which shows that the _five_-stroke character here...represents RR. Sims-Williams  suggests that monograms for LL and RR were generated by ''late but keen-eared ogamists'' to represent the geminate or long liquids /ll/ and /rr/ (1992: 72). The context of this character at Bressay, after DD and before OA , fits Sims-Williams interpretation, but if the _forfid_ is /rr/, what then is meant by the doubling of the ordinary R character on the other line of text (_right 2/3)_   and _26/7_)? As Macalister points out, though it may be easier to read, this character is not easier to carve, and, since there was ample space for two characters, we can only assume some nuance of phonology/orthography drove its inclusion. The only other instance of this character in practical use is at Burrian [BURIN/1, BURIN/2]. It appears in the Book of Ballymote [No. 64, Calder 1917 Aur. 6085), but there all the letters are doubled and the device has no phonetic significance.

Westwood/1876, 74: `With respect to the Oghamic marks, Messrs. T. Wright and C. Roach Smith (Journ. Brit. Arch. Association, Feb. 1847) suggest that the stone has been chipped along this edge, and that the marks which remain are portions of a series of numerals giving the age of the deceased!! In the Archaeologia Cambrensis (1869, p. 153) Mr. Brash clearly proved these marks to be Oghams, but his figure of them in p. 154 by no means corresponds with the true position and form of the marks. These he partially corrected in his article on this stone (Arch. Camb., 1871, p. 158), showing that the marks on the stone, reading upwards from the bottom (and which are reproduced in the lower row of outlines in my plate as far upwards as the letter R in TRILVNI), clearly represent the Oghamic characters for the word TVRPILI ...

`It is surprising that Mr. Brash overlooked the Ogham marks at the top of the stone terminating, or rather commencing, opposite the P at the beginning of the second line. These are added on my plate at the left-hand end of the stone from sketches and rubbings by myself and Mr. Robinson of Cardiff, one of the Secretaries of the Cambrian Arch~ological Association [2]. Prof. Rhys (Arch. Camb., 1874, p. 19) gives these upper marks as equivalent to Lluni, the remains of Trilluni, which occurs as Triluni in the Roman letters.''

Macalister/1945, 315--316: `The first four letters are quite clear, the P being represented by a simplified form of the I-forfid.  The first three notches of the following I are broken away.  There is only one L, though a fracture on the surface preceding it might be mistaken for a second L.  The first two notches of the following I remain, the other three being quite abraded.  Of the surviving notches, one is oblique and appears to be longer than the ordinary notches, so it might be mistaken for an ordinary M ; it is not however, really longer than the vowel notches in the beginning of the inscription.  After this, nothing is clear but LL..N, followed by three vowel notches, at the top of the stone.  The two L''s are crowded together and certainly would have been taken for an S if we had not the corrective guidance of the Roman TRILINI.  The vowel between the L''s and the N is gone : there is hardly room for U, and it most probably was an O. The top of the stone is broken carrying with it the two final notches of the final I.  If there was ever anything in the Ogham corresponding to the concluding DVNOCATI of the Roman [CRCKH/1/2], it is altogether broken away : almost the whole back of the stone has become detached over a cleavage-plane, and it is quite possible that the completion of the inscription may thus have been lost.

`Returning now to the space following TURPILI... the edge is almost worn smooth, but on minute examination the following traces can be detected:---

`1. The B-half of an M, between the TR of the Roman TRILVNI

`2. An S, in line with the R of PVVERI

`3. The first and last scores of a C, in line respectively with the outer tips of the horizontal bars of the E of PVVERI, and with the vertical bar of the same letter.

`4. The T of T[RA]LLONI, in line with the second V of PVVERI.  Nothing remains of the R which should follow ; it must have filled up so much of the available space that it would have been impossible to crowd in the five notches of an I.  There is hardly room for more than the one notch of an A.

Westwood/1879, 3--5: `The inscription is written longitudinally on the northern face, the tops of the letters being near the north-west angle of the stone, where it is much chipped and several of the letters destroyed, this, as I was informed on the spot, having been done by a party of drunken miners from Dowlais out of sheer mischief. The present appearance of the inscription is given in figure 1 of the accompanying Plate, and is described by Mr. J. Rhys in Arch. Camb. 1875, p. 370. It was read for me, (as given by Gough,) by the late Taleisin Williams at Merthyr Tydvil in September, 1846, `_Deffro ini_ (may we awake)''---his father having made several rubbings of it.

`In the letters of E. Lhwyd, preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, is one dated October 10, 1693, in which this inscription is copied, and it is further stated that...the inscription is _Teffro i ti_ or _Deffroi ti_ (mayst thou awake).'' Arch. Camb. 1848, p. 310.     

`In E. Lhwyd''s Archaeologia Britannica, p. 227, a different opinion regarding the inscription was thus expressed: `On a mountain called Mynydh Gelhi Gaer, in Glamorganshire, we find the British name DYVROD inscribed on a stone TEFRAU TI. In the notes on Glamorganshire, in Camden, I have read this inscription, supposing it might have been Welsh, _Deffro it ti_ (mayst thou awake); but having found afterwards that the names anciently inscribed on monuments in our country are very often in the genitive case, as Conbelini, Severini, Aimilini, etc., and most, if not all, Latin, I now conclude it to be a proper name, and the very same that is otherwise called Dubricius.''

`In a paper read by the late Mr. Stephens at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1853, it was stated that the writer preferred the reading of the inscription `VIA FRONTI,'' or `Via Frontini,'' i. e. the way of Frontinus, supposing it to refer to Julius Frontinus, the Roman general. This reading had been first proposed in 1824, by Dr. J. Jones, in his History of Wales (pp. 17, 327), in which the maen-hir itself was regarded as a miliarium. ... 

`In Mr. Lukis''s Memoir on the Cromlechs, &c.,...this maen-hir is mentioned...It is remarkable in having an inscription in Welsh engraved on its eastern face, which our guide told us reads ``DEFROIHI,'''' and means ``Awake unto thee.'''' ''

`The figures which Mr. Lukis has given of this maen-hir, seen from two different points of view, are reproduced at the head of this description (the inscription itself being given as it formerly appeared, although not so stated), whilst the relative position of the maenhir and several adjacent mounds and kists described by Mr. Lukis is shewn in the following woodcut.
 
`According to the late Mr. Thomas Stephens there were no letters visible on this stone when he visited it. `The upper part of the stone has been slit and the inscribed part either destroyed or taken away. This act of vandalism is attributed by the farmers of the locality to a stonemason, named Shon Morgan, who went in a fit of drunkenness to `try the quality of the stone.'' Arch. Camb., 1862, p. 134.

`Lastly, in Huebner''s Inscript. Brit. Christ., p. 22, the ancient representation of the inscription is repeated with the note---`Quae supersunt vestigia Johanni Rhys visa sunt talia efficere: ``tesroihi ;'''' '' whilst in the text the inscription is read `Sfroihi?'' ''

Westwood/1860, 55--57, `the inscription itself, now for the first time published, offers no difficulty, being as follows:---

`EVOLENUS 
`FIL{I} 
`LITOgENI 
`HIC IACIT. 

`There are a few palaeographic peculiarities in this inscription: the second letter in the first line being a U, not V, and the N reversed in shape {N}, the U indistinct and injured, and the terminal S greatly elongated below the other letters; the word is also here in the nominative case.  In the second line the F and I are conjoined, and the final I placed transversely, as is often the case.  In the third line the g is of the Hiberno-British form, and the N again reversed, whilst the H at the beginning of the last line has the transverse bar very oblique, and the A in jacit (for jacet) much elongated below the other letters. With these exceptions the inscription is in Roman capitals, the letters being generally about 4 inches in height...From the more debased form of the letters I infer that it is somewhat more recent than the gravestone of Clutorix. [LDYSI/1]''

Westwood/1879, 113, repeats the above passage, and then adds: `The two supposed terminal letters us offered some difficulty, the seventh letter in Mr. Jones''s notes to me being described as `problematical from the stone being injured there,'' adding, `is the last or eighth letter an s?'' In my published figure the break of the stone over the seventh letter was rendered not sufficiently decided and the letter made too much like a U, whilst the eighth letter, which is earned much below the line and with a very slight top cross bar, led me on the spot to regard it as a S. Prof. Rhys, however, having subsequently visited the stone, read the first word EVOLENGG{I} (Arch. Camb., 1875, p. 186) ; and having shown me his rubbing, which was much clearer than my own, I must admit that the seventh letter is an injured g, that the eighth fetter is also a g, and that it is followed by a horizontal {I} which I had overlooked. In the accompanying Plate LIII, fig. 5, I have given the name as it appears in the rubbing of Prof. Rhys, except that the terminal letters are made too decided.''

Or else, are we to take the letter which  I have here transcribed _v_, and which would probably be as correctly represented by _w_, to have had the value of the vowel _u_ in this inscription?  In that case we might compare such spellings as  that of _Macu Treni_; but it is to be remebered that in Ogam the latter is given as _Maqi Treni_ at full length.''

Rhys/1893, 286, `Then what I was obliged to read as _dd_ may possibly have been ment for  _c_ [in MACV]; but the combination, whether _ddv_ or _cv_ is, to say the least of it, unusual.  If the reading is correct, the _v_ is to be treated as the vowel _u_ as in certain Pictish inscriptions.''

Under even the most favourable circumstances the reading is extremely puzzling...This is what I have made of it:

Efess[a^o][Gw]iAsegni

The first lacuna would take four or five notches ; I give the preference to the former, that is the vowel _e_. As to the next, I am puzzled whether to assign it one or two ; that is _a_ or _o_. After the wider gap the scoring seems to yield _aseg_, followed by three scores on the B side which are complete, and followed by two more imperfect ones : I guess the group to have consisted of five scores, making the consonant _n_. Now _gn_ suggests at once the very common ending _-agn-_, in the genitive _-agni_, in Ogam epitaphs ; but besides _-agni_ there also occur _-egni_ and _-igni_. Looking at the stone itself I could hardly decide between four notches or five, but I find that one of Mr. James''s photographs enables me to decide for four, the vowel _e_. There are two mom>e vowel groups of notches to be guessed, and supposing the whole to end with a word in _-egn-_, I have suggested an _i_ to make a genitive _-egni_, at the end. The width of the gap before _asegn_ seems also to demand at least five notches, which would indicate that the first part of the inscription ended also with a genitive in _i_. Whether this would quite fill that gap I am by no means sure ; but I should hardly go beyond two more scores, whether short or long> This would leave us to choose between _Asegni, Osegni, Basegni, Masegni, Dasegni, Lasegni, Gasegni_ : it is useless to guess any further.
   

`Besides the doubts which enter at the vowel gaps the first vowel and the first consonant make room for another to come in making | ||||////, ef, into |||||///, _ing_, or let us write i[Gw] with the character used by German glottologists for _ng_ : in Ogam the 
[Gw] has the symbol of three slanting scores ///. It happens that the first score of the ///// is not very clearly produced towards the left or the H side ; but it is on the B side. One might perhaps regard that as no part of the writing : then there would be nothing left but a notch as part of the initial vowel. However, the notch, if such, will be found also in the case of the second score of the four, ////. In this case the first name would be _I[Gw]issa[Gw]i_. As regards the first consonant, Mr. James wrote to me before I had seen the stone , as follows :_``The photograph marked 1 shows clearly that there are not more than four long strokes above the lowest group of notches. No. 2 seems to suggest only three, but I noticed that there is a faint long stroke below the three next to the notches on the right side of the edge only. It does not show clearly on the left side of the edge.'''' That is so, and Mr. Eyre Evans, without knowing anything about the photographs, on March 31, 1910, read the slanting scores as four, and not three, without any hesitation. Dr. Owen and I tried to decide the point, but it was raining so hard that we made no satisfactory progress towards that result, and I felt that it would be necessary to examine the Ogam again, if possible not in thunder, in lightning, or in rain. In October 1910 I got a fairly fine day with no rain, and I examined the four slanting scores as carefully as I could : I came to the conclusion that the first was produced beyond the edge on the left or H side, but it was faint as if the surface of the stone had by some accident been abraded there. So I give up considering the first part of the inscription as i[Gw] : this I do as a matter of reading. If, however, anybody wished to treat the name as I[Gw]essa[Gw]i, I may point out one grave difficulty attaching to it_--namely, that all our Ogam inscriptions show only five or six instances of the guttural nasal [Gw] in all, while this reading would supply two more in one and the same word. So any calculation of the chances would, I should think, prove heavily against I[Gw]essa[Gw]i being the right reading.''

The M is to be noticed as having its first and last strokes slanting like a W turned upside down (M); and in the second M the tops of these two strokes are carried higher than the places of junction of the strokes of the middle V, giving the letter somewhat of the appearence of the _rustic-shaped_ capital M, which is also an indication of very great age in Roman inscriptions, occuring very often in those found at Pompeii.  The L and I in the first word are conjoined, the I not being so tall as the L, and extending below the line;  this conjunction indicates a debased style, and which I have seen carried so far that the L and I were formed thus [L I ligature drawn] (The _i_ at the end of the words is often carried like a _j_, below the line, in early Irish and Anglo-Saxon MSS).  The F and R are also debased in their forms, especially the latter, in which the first stroke extends slightly below the line, the loop is very large, and the bottom right hand stroke almost horizontal.  We have here, therefore, an approach to the debased miniscule R [drawn] as it appears for instance on some of the Llantwit stones...The M and A, too, in the beginning of the word MARTINI are conjoined.

In Isidore this word is glossed as meaning ''the hut'' or ''the rough and wild place'' - or a hermitage and a desert.

I think, however, that the whole must be read---

`VECTI FILIVS
`GVAN HIC IACIT.

`The letters are very irregular in size ; the second letter of the upper line seems intended for an E, the top cross-stroke being broken off and the middle cross-stroke extended so as to join the next letter, clearly C ; this is followed by a vertical stroke, at the top of which I perceive traces of a horizontal one, making a T, there being a very slight line uniting the bottom of the vertical one with the following stroke, indicated in the rubbing, but which I regard as no part of the letter, as all the other strokes are of uniform thickness and distinct. The top of the next letter, F, is also broken off, but it clearly commences the word FILIUS.

`The first letter of the second line is of very unusual form, and might at first sight be mistaken for S.[1] It is however a well-known but uncommon form of G (like a C followed by a gigantic comma). The next letters, VAN, are conjoined, the second stroke of the V forming the first stroke of the A. The remaining letters are clear, the whole being in good Roman capitals and referrible to the Romano-British period. ...

[1] In fact the inscription, owing to the broken tops of some of the upper letters, had been read VICARIVS SWAN HIC IACIT, and had been supposed to be raised to the memory of a former Vicar of the parish, of there being a meadow near the church which goes by the name of `Swan''s Meadow,'' or `Swan''s Acre,'' to the present day. It need hardly be observed that the stone is many centuries older than the time of worthy Vicar Swan.''

Rhys/1895, 180--181 (talking about Westwood''s figure): `Let me say, in the first place, that HIC IACIT does not slope upwards towards the end, but runs horizontally below a sort of straight line in the stone.  The top of the A stands above that line, for this A, as well as the other A, is taller than the other letters, a peculiarity to be noticed in the old inscriptions of Cornwall.  In the next place, the crack which divides the second line of letters from one another runs down along a letter I, the cutting for the lower half of which is visible, but the direction of the crack in Westwood''s drawing is not quite right.  The upper part of the I is gone with a bit of the stone, its placed being filled up with cement.  The first line of letters is so close to the present edge of the stone that I can find no trace of the top bar of the E, of the F or of the T.  So the reading VECTI is only a guess, though it is pretty certain to be correct.  The letter V, however, is not the first of the line, for at the very edge, where the stone has had a piece broken off some time or other, there is writing which looks like an inverted C.  One cannot expect here the prefix _con_, so I can only think that it is the latter portion of a D or P.  The former is the more probable; and it that case it is further probable that the whole word was some such a Latin name as _Advectius_, or _Advectis_; but I must confess that I do not know whether such a name occurs or whether a Celtic form _Duecti_, is out of the question.  As to the first letter of the father''s name, it looks like a good C with a smaller C inverted around the lower edge of the bigger character.  On the whole, I am disposed to think with Westwood, that all this was ment for a G; but however that may be, it is misplaced in his plate, as it should be almost exactly under the C of the top line;  and the other letters of the second line should also be shifted some two places towards the right hand.  The part of the stone underneath {C}VE is one of the pieces which has been lost, and it becomes a question whether it bore any writing.  It was lost at a time when the stone was found in the old wall; Mr. Davies, the rector and the historian of Gower, remembers seeing it , and he is positive and distinct in his statement to me, that the piece in question had no writing of any kind on it.  One or two remarks remain to be made as to the lettering.  The _i_''s of _filius_ are attached to the lower bar of the F, and to the bottom end of the L respectively.  The VA is conjoint, and the letters altogether fairly regular.''

Macalister/1945, 382, `The lower line is complete, for though the part before the writing is lost, it was remembered (1895) that there was no writing upon it.  The G''s are of peculiar shape, resembling an upright and an inverted C interlocked into the semblence of an S.  The FI, LI of FILIVS are ligatured; the A of IACIT rises above the top line of the writing.  The G at the present beginning of the inscription is damaged ; of its upper curve only the tip remains, but the lower curve is perfect, just stopping short of the fractured edge of the stone.  This latter should not have been read as a D (1895)"|LMADC/1/1

`The construction of the genitive with _Hic iacit_ is well established.  It is due to a confusion of two formulae, [_Hic ets lapis_] _Rusticae_ and _Hic iacit Rustica_.  The custom of using the genitive on stones under the influence of the first formula had become so stereotyped, that in defiance of grammar it was continued after the second formula was introduced.  That the latter common formula has not been adopted mechanically on the stone before us, but has been modified by the interpolation of the words _in tumulo_, shows that some thought was given to the composition of the epitaph.''  Macalister then goes on to state that he does not agree with Rhys'' attempt to show the metricality of these inscriptions.

Nash-Williams/1950, 178: `The extended formula _Hic in tumulo iacit_, like the simple _Hic iacit_, is of Christian-Roman origin. It appears in Italy in the 4th century A.D., and subsequently comes into vogue, in variant forms, in N.

`Cracks in the surface of the stone render it difficult to assert that the second letter of the name in the third line is an A[1], and whether the marks after the X in the sixth line are three numeral I''s[2], There is not however the slightest ground for reading the letter before the X as a L, as has been suggested by Huebner (Inscriptiones, p. 43, No. 125)... 

`It is clear however from several rubbings before me that the E at the end of the third line is preceded by a straight upright stroke near the first stroke of the E, which seems intended for a diphthong A/E, making the name R(E?)STA/ECE...

`[2]   The Rev. D. R. Thomas proposes to read VI after the V (i.e. AN. IX. VI[XIT]), according to the ordinary sepulchral formula, hut it appears to me that the stroke which he considers to be the first slanting stroke of the V is only a crack in the stone, extending from the middle stroke of the first N in the fifth line to below the sixth line. Prof. Rhys (Arch. Camb., 1876, p. 245) says, `Perhaps neither _an._ IXIII nor _an._ LXIII is correct, for it may possibly be _ani._ XIII for annis XIII.'' The O following the three I''s is very minute, and seems scarcely intended for a letter.''

For some reason the inscription was left unfinishedn : the work was interrupted just after the engraver had blocked out in faint outline the C of PAC[E], and was never resumed.

This last, however, must in Ogham be written _lica_, as Ogamic _cc_ had the sound of the spirant _ch_. The philological interest of this word is second only to that of _inigena_ on the Eglwys Cymmun stone...  What the name before _lica_ was I cannot say, but it was probably the genitive of a man or woman''s name.  Compare names like _Lec-Bébhionn_, now Lickbevune Castle, in county Kerry, and _Llech-Gynfarwy_ in Angelsey.  In Irish, however, the word _lecc_ is a good deal confused with aa masculine _lia_, genitive _liacc_, which also means ``a stone'''', but is according to Dr. Whitley Stokes, derived from an early form _lêvink_, which is not the word on th Loughor Altar.''

Whitley Stokes'' copy of the above, now in UCL library, is annotated, and has the `e'' in Lehori underlined, and `/u?'' in the margin.

The relevant portions of Rhys/1873a, 198 and Brash/1873, 286--287 were quoted at length by Westwood, and are reproduced below. This acrimonious debate is described by Macalister as `obsolete controversial matter'' (Macalister/1945, 381).

Westwood/1879, 40, `...considerable time was spent over the monument, and the accuracy of the delineation may be fully depended upon. The Oghams begin from the bottom, and read upwards from left to right, as is usual in similar cases.''

`These letters are represented in Mr. H. L. Jones''s figure here copied;--- two oblique lines between the chippings of the edge of the stone, a dot above the upper chipping, followed by three oblique strokes to the right, then five dots, and at the top, in the curved space below the square cornice or abacus of the top of the altar, four oblique lines to the left of the middle line. These marks Mr. Jones considers to represent L(?)...ASIC, and he is further induced to consider that they were cut on the edge of the stone after it had ceased to be used as an altar, and when it served for a commemorative purpose ; and hence that it is to be considered, not as of pre-Christian times, but of a date later than the departure of the Roman garrison from the adjoining station... 

`Prof. Rhys (Arch. Camb., 1873, p. 198) maintains that `the reading is L(?)VIC, which, if the drawing be correct, should be completed by inserting E, which makes it LEVIC, that is, according to the Irish method of reading, Lefic. The former reminds one strongly of Leucarum, the name of the Roman station in the neighbourhood. But which are we to trust, Mr. H. L. Jones''s reading or his drawing?'' In his Notes (p. 7) he, however, gives a different reading, observing, `After it (the stone) had been cut for an altar, an inscription in Celtic was made on it, which is now very hard to read---it may be Lehoric or even Vehomagic. Were the former correct, it might stand for Lehori C., i. e. Lehori Castra, meaning Cas Llychwr, which is the name by which Loughor is known in modern Welsh.'' On which I may observe that it is not at all usual on these Celtic or Romano-British stones to use initials alone, and that it is also not common to inscribe localities on them.

`Mr. Brash, whose experience of the Ogham inscriptions in Ireland was very considerable, states (Arch. Camb., 1873, p. 286) that he had examined and copied the Loughor stone. He says, `The inscription is much damaged. Only two letters are determinable, IC. Before the I are two scores across the angle, which, if a letter, would be G, but as there is a flake off the angle before it, it may have formed portion of an R. There is neither an L nor an F on the stone. Farther down is one score, but as the angle before and after it is damaged, it cannot be determined whether it is an M or a portion of another letter.''

Rhys/1895, 182--83: `This stone was visited by me in 1874, when I was quite inexperienced in reading Ogams, and as the inscription was very imperfect, I did not feel much the wiser on seeing it; the only characters which I then thought certain were the Ogams for _ic_, and these I found there again. ... I read it now as follows: ---

`L    LICA

`Here we have the Goidelic word _lica_, as to which I feel no doubt, except that it might possibly be _leca_, for the notches for the first vowel are in a somewhat bad state of preservation.  Add to this, that after the _a_ comes a small fracture which is, I think, no part of the writing; otherwise one would have to read _o_ instead of _a_.  Before the _lica_ we have traces of the final vowel of a previous word, and some distance lower the scores for _l_; but the edge is too much damaged to aloow of anything more being made out.  Even this far exceeded my expectation, and I consider that one reason for my being able to read more this time was, that ivy had overgrown the stone, so that when it was torn off it left the surface clean, at any rate clear of lichen, which is the great obstructor to reading what is written on stones in the open air...it has further interest, that it is so placed that its _a_ is written underneath the moulding in a position where no man in his senses would have ever begun his writing of the Ogams.  So one may be practically certain that the Ogams read upwards on the edge of the altar, as one in any case would expect them to do.''

The invocation at the beginning seems to be peculiar to Wales; but the `pro anima'' has its equivalent in the `or ar anmain'' of the Irish sepulchral inscriptions, and the `gibbidaed der saule'' of the Northumbrian stones.''

Rhys/1899, 154--55: `As to _properabit_ for _preparauit_, see the remarks on _proparabit_, which we have had on Grutne''s cross; and _anc_ doubtless represents the pronunciation which was given to _hanc_. The mistakes here are of a different type from those which disfigure the cross of ``Samsoni Apati''''. 

`In the absence of the second _et_ this cross reminds one of the Merthyr Mawr one, reading _Inomine di patris et fili speritus_, to be mentioned next. On the other hand, it resembles the Grutne cross in having, as it seems to me, the ring of genuine Latin of the kind that was taught in this country. In fact, it is interesting as betraying a touch probably of Brythonic pronunciation : the spelling _Res_ for what is now Rhys has its parallel in _lenn_ for _llyn_ ``lake'''', and _glen_ for _glyn_ ``glen'''', in some old verses in the Mabinogi of Math (Oxford _Mabinogion_, p. 78); also in _cet_, later _cyd_, ``though'''', in one of the Englynion in the Cambridge ``Juvencus Codex'''' (Skene''s _Four Ancient Books of Wales_, ii, 2). But the pronunciation indicated by the _e_ of _Res_ prevailed also doubtless in the _e_ of _patres_ and _speretus_ for _patris_ and _spiritus_. The spelling _santdi_ is to be pronounced _santhi_ : compare _luidt_ for _luith_, now _llwyth_, ``tribe'''', in one of the charters in the Book of St. Chad (see the _Book of Llan Dâv_, p. xliii), and _santhi_ would represent a pronunciation with the _ct_ of _sancti_ reduced as usual in Welsh to _th_. As a Welsh word _sanctus_, genitive _sancti_, became _seith_ (with the nasal omitted), as in _Seith Pedyr_, ``Saint Peter'''', in the _Book of Taliessin_, poem v (Skene, ii, 120).''

Macalister/1949, 156, `Theologically, the inscription is interesting, as it shews the erector of the cross tainted with the heresy which identified the Son with the Holy Spirit.''

Iolo Morganwg read the stone, and a drawing of it survives in manuscript, reproduced in 1893 (RomillyAllen/1893, 328).  The reading is full or errors and was annotated by Romilly Allen (p. 328).

Rhys/1899, 154, `The beginnings of the lines have been chipped off, except the first, which is probably complete, and begins with _ninomine_ for _in nomine_. The initial blunder arose probably from the inscriber having first made the five perpendiculars of inn and then carelessly joining the two first, so that he made what should have been _in_ into _ni_. There is a mark of contraction over the _di_; the _et_ is a conjoint character, and it is followed by a small [capital-Lambda], which on being examined with a candle was seen to have a short tag which made it into F.[1] Above it is a mark which I take to indicate that the F stands for FILI : the inscriber would seem to have accidentally omitted that word, so he made it good so far as room and symmetry allowed. Westwood erroneously represents the _et_ as made up of two separate letters, one of which seems to cover the space taken up by the small F. In the last two lines the _s_''es are of the rounded kind, but reversed, and the last of all is adorned with two points. The _r_ in patris is joined to the following _i_; the _n_''s in _santdi anc_ have their first perpendicular prolonged downwards below the level of the second, while the _n_ in _anima_ is more like an h. The spelling _eus_ for _eius_ is probably due to carelessness.

But what remains of the U looks now as if it might have been an E, though the horizontal indications may be mere portions of the breakage. The position of the word _Regis_ suggests that it was due to an afterthought, when the inscriber had considered that the name Samson was too common.

Gibson added the following explanations in support of his reading : `In old inscriptions we often find the letter V where we use O, as here, PRONEPVS for Pronepos (vide Reines. Syntagma Inscript. p. 932), so that there was no necessity of inventing a character [an oblique line within a circle] made use of in earlier editions of Camden''s work''...With regard to the terminal words of the inscription, Camden adds, `Sepulchres are in old inscriptions often called domus aeternae, but aeternales [eternali] seems a barbarous word. The last words I read aeternali in domo, for in that age sepulchres were called aeternales domus, or rather aeternae (Reines. p. 716), according to this dystich,
 
`Docta lyre grata et gestu formosa puella 
Hic jacet aeterna Sabis humata domo.'' 

`On carefully looking at this inscription several peculiarities are noticeable, the most important of which is the Greek cross incised upon the truncated top of the stone, extending by a line to the inscription on the face of the stone, thus, it appears to me, clearly indicating that the deceased Bodvoc was a Christian. In the next place, the first name is given as Bodvocus by Camden, overlooking the transverse stroke after the C, clearly intended to turn the name into the genitive ease, Bodvoci, according to the common formula in the inscriptions of this early period in Wales. In the same manner Camden overlooked the cross line at the end of the inscription, which would cause it also to terminate with a genitive name, Vedomavi...The S in Catotis has been misread g, but there is not the slightest indication of the top cross bar...''

''

Rhys/1899, 143--144, `In early Medieval Irish z was treated as an equivalent for _st_, and it is fairly certain that our inscriber would not regard his z as the soft sibilant of such words as _zeal_ or _zero_, as that sound was unknown in Celtic, whether Goidelic or Brythonic. One of the most remarkable things about this inscription is, that it seems to represent the author of the inscription''s pronunciation of Latin phonetically: thus we have _inomine_ for in _nómine_, and _anma_ for _ánima_; whence in the same way Modern French _âme_ for Old French _anme_, Spanish _alma_. The _b_ in __proparabit_ was to be here pronounced _v_ as in _Conbelin_, and as in Latin from the fourth century down: see such forms as _comparabit se biba_ for _comparavit se viva_ in De Rossi''s Christian Inscriptions found in Rome, vol. i, No. 1125. The _o_ in _proparabit_ is of a different origin, being due, no doubt, to confusion of the Latin prefixes _prae_ and _pro_: it is attested elsewhere in Med. Irish _procept_ `teaching'', from the Latin _praeceptum_; while the related Welsh word was _pregeth_, originally meaning the act of teaching, but now only a sermon. It may be pointed out that the phonetic writing is quite of a piece with the simple syntax of the inscription: thus, judging from other instances, we have to take by itself _In nomine. dei summi crux Christi_, or treat it as equivalent to _In nomine dei summi incipit crux Christi_; and then it should have gone on with _quam preparavit Grutne_, but such a construction appears to have been too complicated for the Latinity of the author of this legend.''

The letters are rude minuscules, mixed with uncials (such as the Benedictine authors of the `Nouveau Traité de Diplomatique'' would have called semiuncial), the d open and rounded with the second part a little inclined to the left at top, the S both f and S shaped, the r with the second part much elongated, the g of the minuscule form with the top cross-stroke long. The letters are irregular in size and position in the lines, and of a ruder character than those on the stone of Brancuf. The omission of the n in the first word In (nomine) appears to have been intended simply to prevent duplication of the letters. The same peculiarity occurs on the great cross at Merthyr Mawr. The word `anima'' seems to have been rather troublesome, as we find it not only misspelt here, but on Samson''s cross at Llantwit it is written `anmia'' (although correctly given by Rhys and Hübner).''

Rhys/1899, 141--143, `As to the next Margam cross, I had only time to look at it hurriedly in 1897, but I felt confident that it had been correctly read. On my visit in 1898, however, I had plenty of leisure to scrutinise it, and to discover, to my surprise, that we have always misread it, especially the fifth line, which has been treated as _Critdi_...At all events, there is no doubt but that we are to read the beginning of this legend as _inomine_, and I am inclined to read the end Anest, and to regard that as an earlier form of the woman''s name Nest: the perpendicular of the _n_ in Anest is no taller than that of the first _n_ in _inomine_, but it is straight or perpendicular, while that of the letter in _inomine_ is not really so, as it bends backwards a bit at the top. However, I should not quarrel with anyone who wishes still to read _Ahest_, provided he does not further try to make it a form of the Latin word _eius_. The letter which has been read t in the impossible form _Critdi = Christi_ is not a _t_, but has the shape of a z; but it may be doubted whether it was intended for z rather than for s. Thus we have s and sometimes a reversed s; and on the Clydey stone of Dobituci we have the former made with angles instead of curves, and looking, consequently, like an inverted z, namely, in _FILIVS_. So our instance here may be a reversed s similarly angulated into the shape of z. But, on the other hand, the inscriber may have intended a z, and in that case he probably congratulated himself on achieving a novelty in the spelling of the word Christi.''

`ANM COLMAN AILITHIR

` ``Name of Colman the Pilgrim.''''  But he has blundered so badly that he has made the decipherment of the inscription a very difficult matter.  At best, the  inscription is a ``scholastic'''' essay.

`On the vertical part of the stem line he wrote ANM COL.  He then realized that if he continued here he would have his N at the angle, and, consequently, awkwardly cramped; or else, if he carried on past the angle, it would run into the B-half of the M.  Accordingly, he skipped the angle and wrote MAN on the horizontal branch of his stem-line.  He then wrote AIL, the beginning of AILITHIR, before he saw that this word would have to be shortened to fit into the available space, which he had rashly reduced by cutting the second cross.  A feeling of reverence may have prevented him from making room for himself by breaking this away.  Accordingly, he squeezed an L into the space between the A and the I---its cramped nature is obvious---thus abolishing the first I of the word AILITHIR, and adapting the I which he had already fashioned to represent the second I of this word.  He next had to dispose of the L which was already on the stone, and for which he would be obliged to substitute a T.  This he ingeniously effected by cutting a line joining the distal ends of the two scores, thus turning these underline scores into overline scores, and then adding one more, and only one, in the orthodox position above the main stem-line.  This gave him the three overline scores of the T.  He then proceeded with the final IR, which just filled the available space, though it went beyond the range of the stem line which he had laid out at the beginning.  In order to make his correction clear, he wrote in the turn of the angle of the stem line, which still remained blank, the letters O.L.Th---the Th being represented by the O-_forfid_---meaning _ó L, Th_---``from `L'' [make] `Th.'' ''''  This gives us a neat demonstration of the consonantal value of that character, and a further corroboration of the Greek origin of the Ogham script.

`[1] In Edw. Lhwyd''s letter of the 20th December, 1702, to the Rev. Humphrey Foulkes, we find the first word spelt differently, probably being a lapsus calami. (It is however to be observed that the stone clearly shews two strokes between the l and n, so that the word must have been either conbelani, as read by Petrie, or conbeloni, or conbellini.) The writer remarks, `I have observed that the Romans and ancient Britans (sic) expressed _Kyn_ in the British names by Cuno, but towards the eighth century both the Brittans and Irish rendered it _Con_: for the British name Kynvelyn was written by the Romans _Cunobelinus_, and I found it on an old crosse in Glamorganshire Conbolini : and that (according to their skill in grammar) in the nominative case.'' (Coll. of W. W. E. Wynne, Esq., copied in Arch. Camb. 1859, p. 248.)''

Rhys/1899, 158--160, `The beginning of the first line is gone, and the _p_ of second line is damaged; but there is the statement of Ed. Lhwyd''s, that he read _Conbelini posuit hanc crucem pro anima ejus._ On my previous visit I read what remains of the first line as _nbelini_; but, on examining it very carefully again, I have come to the conclusion that Westwood''s reading (Lap., p. 16) is the right one. The inscription is a curious mixture of minuscules and somewhat debased capitals, `so that it is hard to say whether _u_ is to be represented as V or as U, and the phases of the R are also impossible to produce exactly in type; but, on the whole, it is the capital R, with a tendency of the last limb to assume a horizontal or even an upward position, while both the T and the L in _Scitliuissi_ are, I should say, rather capitals than not : the three points after this vocable are somewhat doubtful. The C of _hanc_ is rather angular, and so is the first _c_ of _Sciloc_, which has been sometimes taken for a t. The _n_''s vary considerably : that of hanc has its first perpendicular prolonged somewhat below the level of the other, while the _n_ of _anima_ looks somewhat like an _h_; but what I have read as _h_, in _Herttan_ differs from both, as the top is turned backwards. What I have read _tan_ in Herttan requires notice, as it is partly faint or damaged : I think the first letter a t, and the next letter is imperfect, as there are small breakages which extend from the groove; but I cannot make either _b_ or _d_ of it, though the cracks make it look somewhat like those letters at first sight. It is, I believe, an _a_, just as the next letter is not an _o_. This last now looks an oblong, which to my thinking will make nothing but a damaged n. The _et_ is everywhere a conjoint character. The _e_ of _ame_ is doubtful and peculiar, but I think it looks more like _e_ than _a_; the second _a_ of _prepara_ is also somewhat strange in its form. Lastly, I do not suppose [four dots] is meant to be read _est_ as Westwood supposed : he abstained from suggesting how he construed the whole.

But we have probably a touch of the local pronunciation in _grefium_ : that, I think, is the reading, and not _grafium_, but I am not certain. This word _grafium_ or _graphium_ in Welsh Latinity meant a writing, charter or document (see Seebohm''s _Tribal System_, pp. 211, 212, 217), and the changes of sound which it underwent in Welsh to become _graiff_ may be represented by _graphium, grephium_ or _grefium, greifium, greif_ or _greiff, graiff_. Of course if one reads _santdi_ we have another touch of Welsh pronunciation. At all events, this cross probably belongs to the same period as that of Houelt. 

`Lastly, the words _in proprium_ and _in grefium_ seem to show that in this inscription we have a reference to a formal document commemorating some such transaction as the gift of a piece of land to a religious community. Compare a similar document on the Llanllyr Cross, _Arch. Camb._, 1896, pp. 119--25.

`As to the formula _I(n) nomine Dei Patris et Fili Spiritus Sancti_, we have had it already on the Cross of Houelt, and it seems to mean, ``In the name of God the Father and of the Son the Holy Spirit.'''' I have shown both to Mr. F. C. Conybeare, who has devoted to them a brief notice in his Paulician work called ``The Key of Truth.'''' Among other things he says : ``This formula takes us straight back to _The Shepherd_ of Hermas, in which the Son of God is equated with the Holy Spirit, and it also exactly embodies the heresy of which Basil deplored the prevalence in the eastern regions of Asia Minor. These inscriptions, therefore, rudely disturb the ordinary assumption, that the early Celtic Church was ``catholic in doctrine and practice''''; as if Bede had meant nothing when he studiously ignored St. Patrick and denied that the British bishops even preached the Word''''. He says of the other formula, _In nomine Dei Summi_, that it seems to be both praetrinitarian and connected with the series of inscriptions in honour of [some Greek], found in Asia Minor, and referred by Schurer and Franz Cumont to Jewish influence''''. He ends his note with the words : ``The survival of such formulae on these old Welsh crosses explains why Bede rejected the baptism of the British Christians, and why Aldhelm (A.D. 715) denied that they had the _Catholicae fidei regula_ at all.''''[1] The absence in our inscriptions of anything explicitly trinitarian is remarkable, and I should like to see the question more fully discussed. Lastly, I am reminded by the Editor of the remarkable fact that no representations of the Trinity, or symbols of the Trinity, occur in Celtic art.

`[1] Mr. Conybeare has since had a paper on the ``Welsh Church'''' printed in the _Transactions_ of the Hon. Society of Cymmrodorion.''

Rhys/1905, 40--41, discusses the metre of the inscription and then goes on to state: `Lastly, as to the nature of the transaction referred to as committed to a written document, here called _grefium_, that is _graphium_, I have no doubt that it was a legal acquisition by the deceased of the plot of ground which was to be his burial place, where this cross, probably of the seventh or eight century, was originally set up.  Plenty of illustrations occur in the Christian epitaphs of the Continent,  such as those of Rome collected by De Rossi.  We have another Celtic instance, to be mentioned shortly, in the case of the Llanllyr stone, where a saint is also made a party to the transaction.  The country round Merthyr Mawr was decidedly within the sphere of the influence of St. Iltutus or Illtud, but the state of the legend does not enable one to define the part which the saint was supposed to act through his successor at the time here in question: probably the transaction would not have been considered valid without the latter''s express approval.''

Macalister/1928, 309--310, discusses the implications of this inscription for the theology of the Welsh church.

Macalister, quoted in Anon/1928, 371: `The inscription, on the whole, is in better Latin than its companion, but the meaning of one expression---IN GREFIUM---remains obscure.''

Macalister/1949, 161: `The legal terms at the end, indicating a perpetuity of appropriation of the site of the monument, are interesting.''

Nash-Williams/1950, 155: `The purport of the inscription is apparently to dedicate some property by deed to a church or monastery (cf. No. 255).''

The fourth line from the bottom seems to read _saisto_ or _caisto_, which seems to make _isto_ and the end _sa_ or _ca_ of a preceding word : we thus have _isto in grefium_ for _isto in grafio_---try _terra inclusa isto in grafio._ The word _usque_ is partly abbreviated _usq_ : but the reading is pretty certain.

`It is hardly worth the while to discuss these guesses in detail, but the following notes may prevent them misleading anybody:-- The _s_ is everywhere of the angular gamma form: the contraction of _dei_ has the line over the _d_.  _fili speritus_ is certain, and the adjacent seems to be spelt _sagti_, there is no room for an _n_.  The _ha_ at the end of line 3 is fairly certain, but not so _nc cruce_ of the next line, which those letters would rather crowd; perhaps if I have hit on the right words the spelling was _hancrucem_, just as we have _inomine_ for _in nomine_.  _pro an_ is a guess.  The _t_ in line 5 may be a _g_.  Line 7 seems to begin with _n_ or _si_, but the only letter I could feel certain about is the _e_.

All those who have seen the stone agree on CATIRI for the second line ; otherwise we might be tempted to suggest that if it should ever come to light again---an improbable contingency---the second name would be found to have been CATVRIGI.''

The F is much the usual type, with its lower arm drooping a little.  The second limb of the V tends to end with a slight curvature, except the last V, which ends well under the roof of the T.  The R is rather an elegant letter, but its perpendicular is prolonged somewhat beneath the line.  The final I is of the usual horizontal kind.  I had no time to try to take a rubbing of the stone, and even had I time, I do not think it could have been done to any advantage while the stone is in its present position.  The letters GLO are very faint, and some of the others are not much less faint; so I gather that all that face had been a good deal exposed to the weather, or more likely, to the tread of feet, before the stone was placed where it is now.''

Rhys visited the stone again in 1909 after it had been removed from the wall and stated: `a difficulty which still remains, as to the NI.

Rhys/1913, 68: `now that the whole has been got out and cleaned the readings allow no room for doubt except at one point in the Latin version...Now the M and A come out large and sprawling. except that the top of the A is damaged; the G is not of the shape I had supposed, as it is of the ordinary reaping-hook form.  The L tends to have its perpendicular prolonged somewhat below its horizontal line.  The first V seems joined to the top of the preceding C, and that of CLUTOR{I} ends under the roof of the T, which is a rather tall letter, though not so tall as the R, which is taller than all the letters near it, just as the O is somewhat smaller than the other letters.  The F is a rather decadent letter with its short bar drooping; the last and final I is horizontal.   There is no trouble as to the reading of any of the letters except at the end of the first name.  The previous time I suggested {backwards-N}I, though I could not closely examine the spot.  Now, on closer scrutiny, I cannot satisfy myself as to the presence of {N}I : if one reads {N} there is no I, and if one reads I there is no {N}. I  was not a little influenced by Lloyd, the mason, who insisted  that the last letter but one was a V, like the V immediately preceding it.  So far as the roughness of the stone permits one to decide, the I does not seem to touch the nearest writing before it : that is, it could not be {N} but VI, though there is no objection to {N} as such, for it occurs on the Vitaliani stone close by.  On the whole I think one must read the Latin gentive as MAGLOCVVI ad the whole as MAGLOCVVI FILI CLVTO{I}.''

The three terminal letters, AQI, would seem to imply the previous M to make the word (M)AQ(U)I=MAC of the usual formula; but although there is a space between the last of the five dots=I, and the dot representing the second A (which should be a single oblique stroke crossing the angle of the stone, and extending on both the right and left sides of the angle), yet our various rubbings and drawings, as well as in Mr. Brash''s notice, there is no trace of such a stroke.  The oblique fracture at the top of the stone may have possibly broken off some more of the ogham characters, which might have been the letters of the father''s name.''

It appears to contain the female personal-name _Tanguistel_ recorded twice of different persons in the Margam charters of the twelfth-century.  There is also _Merthir Gliuis_ in _Bk. of Llandâv, p.225, which is identified in an editorial note as _Clivis_ at Newton Nottage.  Both places are within a short distance of Merthyr Mawr.''

Macalister/1949, 163: `There is some parallelism between this and the last inscription [Macalister/1949, no. 1023].  Both relate, in different ways, to the appropriation of a piece of ground (the _Conbelani_ inscription is not necessarily sepulchral).  Both invoke `Gliguis'' and Nerttan.''

Nash-Willams/1950, 160: `As Sir Ifor Willams has shown, the inscription apparently records the dedication of a piece of land to a church or monastry.  Glywys, a local saint, and Nertat are perhaps mentioned again on No. 239.''

These, together with rubbings, were submitted to Professor R. A. S. Macalister, who kindly sends the following detailed commentary :---  

`Of the other inscription (Fig. 6), the first surviving line is too fragmentary for decipherment. It preserves part of the letters E R C (or T or conceivably U) I...but there is nothing to show to what sort of word these letters belong. I take it for a field-name.

`The second line is quite clearly QUOD DEO.

`The next gives us the name ARTHMAIL. Unfortunately his parentage is not recorded. He may be the son of Iudhail, king of Glywysing, whose family was closely associated with Abbot Samson at Llantwit (see _Book of Llandav_, ed. Evans and Rhys, p. 191). Another Arthmail, king of Gwent, performed exactly the same act of making over a property to the church, as is recorded in the same book, p. 237. 

`Then comes AGRUM DA. I think the last letter is A, not O ; its sinister side is flattened; and I think further that I can trace in the rubbing the little projections above and below which distinguish the letter from an O. If the QUOD of the line but one above is meant to agree with AGRUM, it should have been QUEM; but I need not say that anything is possible in the Latinity of these inscriptions.

`In the next line we have [A over T] G L I G U I S, of which for the moment I need only say that the minuscular T, beneath the A, presumably completes the word DAT.

`A peculiar character begins each of the two following lines. I take it to be a compendium for ET, found frequently in MSS., and in stone in the inscription on Caldey Island (for I have quite abandoned an interpretation which I once adventured of this inscription, which gave a different meaning to the character). Passing over the next line for the present, we come to the last line, which appears to read ET FILI EPILI --- recalling the Epillus whose name appears on the coins of the Lemovices, and a lady named Epilla, who dedicated a votive inscription found at Luxeuil. The line above is disturbed with horizontal strokes, like that already noticed on the other face ; it looks like ET NER[A over T]. The N is of the minuscular form ; and I am tempted into the mazes of speculation by the resemblance of this name to HERTTAN, found on one of the Merthyr Mawr chapel inscriptions. The minuscular N and minuscular H are very like one another ; have we here one and the same man, who may have been called either Nerttan or Herttan? If so, we must infer that when our scribe wrote [A over T], he meant to produce a compendium for TAN. Indeed, there must be some reason why he twice superposed the _a_ to the _t_ within this short inscription, with no apparent reason. If this be sound, we must return to the line above and read it T A N G L I G U I S, the initial T being part of the last word of the preceding line ; which opens further speculations about a possible ANGLICUS having crossed the border, and having become sufficiently naturalized to witness a legal transaction. For that these are the names of witnesses to Arthmail''s deed of gift seems to be the most likely hypothesis. 

`So that I would tentatively interpret this inscription thus :

`ERC(? or T)I [ ]/ QUOD DEO/ ARTHMAIL/ AGRUM DA/T ANGLIGUIS/ ET N(? or H)ERTTAN/ ET FILI EPILI(?)

` ``(the field called) ... erci...which field Arthmail gives to God (in the presence of) Anglicus(?) and Nerttan (?Herttan) and the son of Epilus.'''' ''

Williams/1932, 232--238: `IN Arch. Camb., 1930, 396_402, Mr. Nash-Williams gives a very careful and complete description of an inscribed stone lately discovered at Ogmore Castle, Glamorgan. For the details I must refer the reader to his notes, and the excellent photographs which accompany them. There are two inscriptions, both incomplete, one on the back and the other on the front of the stone. I shall deal only with the latter. 

`Professor Macalister, working on drawings and rubbings prepared in the Department of Archaeology of the National Museum of Wales, read this inscription as ERC(? or T)I [ ]/ QUOD DEO/ ARTHMAIL/ AGRUM DA/TANGLIGUIS/ ET N (? or H)ERTTAN/ ET FILI EPILI(?), and interprets it as ``(the field called) . . . erci . . . which field Arthmail gives to God (in the presence of) Anglicus (?) and Nerttan (? Herttan) and the son of Epilus.'''' He takes _quod agrum_ together, explaining _quod_ as _quem_, for, as he says with much truth, ``anything is possible in the Latinity of these inscriptions.'''' A comparison, however, with certain grants to churches preserved, in the _Book of LLandaf_, and in the _Life of St. Cadog_, suggests another reading and a different interpretation. The first line has been broken off; and this is what I make of the rest:

These, together with rubbings, were submitted to Professor R. A. S. Macalister, who kindly sends the following detailed commentary :---

`_A priori_ one would expect the inscriptions on two faces of a stone fragment to be of the same extent. As there are seven lines of writing on the one face, and only four on the other, I presume that a space for three lines is broken or defaced on the latter side.

`To take the shorter inscription (Fig. 7) first. Obviously it began like one at Margam, IN NOMINE (perhaps written INOMINE) DI SUM (M)I. INOMINE is all broken away except the bottom curve of the E; I think I can trace indications of the bottom of other letters in the rubbing, but without complete assurance. DI SUMI is plain enough, in the second line. A line cut through and below these letters is possibly a guide-line for the engraver; there are similar lines in the Merthyr Mawr inscriptions. But are these lines on the Ogmore stone (for there are others on the other side) certainly artificial? [Yes! V.E.N.-W.] After SUMI there come three letters which appear to be CRO, though the C is not of the shape that we should expect the cutter of this inscription to cut ; its curve is too shallow. But I cannot see how else to take it. The next line begins S I, followed by two uncertain letters. In the second of these, the rubbing suggests a rather square-bottomed U to me rather than the minuscule H of your pencilling; and indeed if these letters are not CROS IHU, I am unable to conjecture how to take them. The Goidelic word cros, instead of the Latin crux, arouses suspicion; but the interpretation will have to stand, so far as I am concerned, till someone thinks of something better. The next word is G E N (I take this letter for a minuscular N) T I --- GENTI. In the following line is the name BRANCUI---presumably the genitive of the name which we find at Baglan, BRANCU (not Brancuf, pace Westwood). A similar (feminine?) name follows in the next line,  B R A N C I(?) E, and I suppose the lost next line began with FILI. So that my tentative interpretation of this inscription is : 

`[IN NOMINE]/ DI SUM(M)I CRO/S(?) IH(ES)U(?) GENTI/ BRANCUT/ BRANCIE(?)/ [FILI   ].

` ``In the Name of the Most High God, the Cross of Jesus for the family of Brancu, (son of) Brancia. . . .'''' ''

Macalister/1949, 163: `Above the O at the end of the first remaining line of the shorter inscription [this one] there is the lower curve of an O or an e belonging to the lost line above.''

Nash-Williams/1950, 160: `Round half-uncials.''

RCAHMW/1976, 56: `The final letter of the first line is 0 rather than U, giving a variant form of Crux, while the final letter of the next line, H rather than I, partly coincides with the incised frame. The complete inscription presumably began with _In Nomine_ (cf. No. 928) and concluded with a conventional phrase (as on Nos. 910-12).''"|OGMOR/1/2

` ...The last word, ORDOUS, has occasioned much difficulty. It was considered by Edward Lhwyd to be an abbreviation for Ordovicus, showing that it was carved by men of South Wales who had welcomed one from the North, and had considered his origin worthy of note when they put over him this stone of honour.

Rhys/1905, 41, `There is plenty of analogy for _cives_ and _consobrinos_ as nominatives singular...and for instances of the final sibilant omitted, as in _cive_ and _magistrati_ ... The conversion of _magistratu~s_ into _magistrati_ is also to be put down as Latin, and not as a whim of the Celtic inscriber...[discussion of names in appropriate table]...The accentuation of  _Venedotis_ I take to have been that of the Brythonic gentive _Venedo~tos_, which was presumably _Venédo~tos_; the later forms are Gwyned, `Veenedota, or N. Wales'', representing a nominative _Venedos or possibly_ Venedos,_ and _Gwyndawt, Gwyndod_, from _Venedo~t-os_, the alternative to  Venédo~t-os...Thus the inscriber would seem to have been Brythonic rather than Goidelic.''

Nash-Williams/1950, 92--93,`Venedos is the Celtic form of the Welsh Gwynedd, the ancient name applied to NW. Wales (comprising roughly Caernarvonshire and the island of Anglesey), which was thus, as the present inscription shows, already separately identified in the sub-Roman period. Consobrinos is the popular-Latin form of the literary consobrinus. Magistrati (for magistratus), by attraction of a 4th Declension noun into the 2nd Declension, can be paralleled in inscriptions of the classical period. This is the only known instance of the occurrence in Britain of the terms civis and magistratus in an early Christian inscription. Their use in the present context is of special interest as. implying the existence of an ordered system of government in NW. Wales in sub-Roman times. It is. possible that an administrative district had been constituted already in the Roman period, centring on the Roman station of Caernarvon (Segontium).'' Mention of the civic antecedents of early Christians in their epitaphs. was not usual, but parallels can be cited on contemporary inscriptions in Italy, N. Africa, and Gaul[2]''.

Rhys/1905, 82--84, provides a long dicussion of this inscription inscluding its possible metre (`accentual hexameter''), connection to Arthurian names etc.  Much of the discussion of the names is a repeat of that in Rhys/1882 (see name memos)."|0|rcaps||"Rhys/1882, 162--63, 165, `We found no indubitable trace of the letters IC or HIC; but there is room enough certainly left vacant for the former ; and I think we noticed a part of the I, and a little part of what may have been a C.  I have very little doubt that they were both once there.  It so happens that at this part of the Stone there is a sort of patch, as it were in relief on the face of it.  The inscriber was, however, not deterred by this, for he began his IACIT on it, though there is now very little left of the first I, and the A is partly gone.  There were some letters before BECCVRI in the last line ; but they are gone, excepting a trace of the tops of some of them, as the stone is chipped in that part...`As to the other characters, the FI consist of an F with a small I attached to its lower horizontal limb.  The NA are conjoint in both lines.  So far as the stone is concerned, it is difficult to decide beyond doubt as to the last letter but one of the first line, whether it is a P or an R.  There is there all that is necessary to make P ; but there is more, namely, a nearly horizontal bar proceeding towards the right from the lower end of the perpendicular, just as though the oblique line of an R had fallen down.  On the whole, however, I am strongly inclined to think that the letter is to be read P, and that the rest in the result of a chipping of the surface of the stone...But I have not yet done with the letters.  The first letter of CVNACI has lost its lower part, as it stood on a part which has been broken off, possibily before the stone left its original position on a grave.  The first vowel of BECCVRI is somewhat rounded like a Greek [epsilon] ; the second C is angular, like a very open V on its side ; and the VR are conjoint.  I do not know of any other instance of this ; and it is possible that I have not hit on the right reading.  The last part of the R is rather distinguished by colour than by any depression or groove, as the surface on both sides of it has flaked off.  The possible remains of this line are, I think, BECC^LVR^B^PI. [Name encoded according to CISP method as print version not possible.]

[In Postscript]  `We carefully examined the inscription again, and thought we found undeniable traces of the adverb IC.  Moreover, it does not seem so correct to say that the A of _jacit_ [sic.] has been partly worn away, as that it was never finished, owing probably to the hardness of the superficial patch alluded to.  I believe now more firmly than ever that the letter I have ventured to read P cannot have been anything else ;  and Mr. Auden, after very careful examination of it with a glass, agrees with me.  As a piece of guesswork, I may add that I find that CIVI would just fit the remains of the letters preceding _Beccvri_.  It will be remembered that CIVE does duty for _civis_ on one of the Penmachno stones.''

The HIC is unlikely as it would have had to be cut in a hard projection on the face of the stone and is not essential before IACIT, but the insertion of a nominative as a subject for IACIT would improve the reading.  Rhys suggested CIVI, but no trace of it now remains...Alternatively, the second part may be an inscription, independant of the first; or the IACIT may be an insertion, as the separation of the word from the well-defined group at the upper end of the stone, and the poorer quality of the lettering would allow.''"|PMRFA/1/1

The older inscription, if we may depend on the fidelity of the engraving, is dedicated, not, as some have pretended, to _Maximian_, but to _Maximin_, who bears upon his coins the title of _Invictus_ (as upon the stone), which is not found on those of _Maximian_. The inscription as it now stands may be read thus---Imp. C. Fla. Val. Maximino Invicto Augus(to). But on looking closer we are led to believe that the first part belongs to a still older inscription, as the C. Fla. Val. (Caius Flavius Valerius) were names which never belonged to Maximin, whose name was Galerius Valerius. (The names of the two Maximians were ``Marcus Aurelius Valerius Maximianus'''' and ``Galerius Valerius Maximianus.'''') The appellation of C. Flavius Valerius belongs to the second Severus, and it is probable that to him this stone was originally inscribed, but that subsequently his name had been erased to give place to that of Maximin by some person who carelessly or ignorantly overlooked the prenomens.''

There were two emperors called Maximinus---Gaius Iulius Verus Maximinus (A.D. 235--238) and Galerius Valerius Maximinus (A.D. 308--314).  The latter is doubtless the person intended.  Flauius Valerius _Seuerus_ was emperor in 306--7; apparently his _praenomina_ were by some error ascribed in the inscription to his sucessor.  Such an error would be most likely to take place just at a change of reign, so that we may confidently date this inscription to A.D. 308.''

At this stage the stone was identical in type with the slab at Llangyfelach, which also bears a cross and nothing more than the same words `CRUX XPI''; but the cross in the latter example is more ornate, and evidently later than the very simple and primitive Port Talbot example.  These crosses are to be considered rather as devotional than as commemorative...

the two inscriptions been contemporary I feel sure that they would have been written in parallel lines.[1]  I am inclined to think that we have the whole of the second inscription, and that it was intended to read GELUGUIN.  Had the line of writing been much longer, we should have expected the superfluous ``n'''' to have been written, for the convenience of the reader, under the _last_ rather than under the first letter.  Moreover, the proportions of the surviving part of the cross suggest that there is not a very great length of the stem lost, and as the cross would most likely occupy as much as possible of the space available, I do not suppose that the slab was ever very large, or that there was room upon it for many more letters---not enough to make another word.  Impressions are, of course, very fallacious, but certainly I derive from the photograph an impression of an inscription that has just fitted into the space which the present size of the stone allows.''

Westwood/1879, 27, `The word `properavit''  naturally suggests the addition of the words `hanc crucem,'' and Mr. Rhys has ingeniously suggested that the proper name is not Gaic but Gai, and the apparently terminal letter c the initial of the word `crucem;'' whilst the apparent fragment of a letter at the commencement of the fourth line is considered by him to indicate a r (making with the preceding c crucem) or a h, whence he would read the inscription as Proparauit Gai, c. h., that is, Prepauravit Gai crucem hane. `At all events,'' he says, `I do not believe in a name _Gaic_. whereas we have in the Annales Cambriae, _Gaii_ Campi, which in a later MS. is given as _Gai_.''

At first I thought _Nomena_ must  be a proper name, and that the whole meant _Rinaci filia Nomena_; but I know of no other instance of such a formula with _filia_ or _filius_ left out.  Another way of looking at the inscription would be to regard it as consisting of a name with an epithet appended to it, and treat _Rinaci_ as a nominative feminine, say for _Rinacis_; but the conjecture has not led me to any solution of the difficulty.  So I fall back on the possibility of Nomena standing for Latin _nomina_, just as we have _Emeret-o_ on another Pembrokeshire stone for _Emerito_.  But what would _Rinaci Nomina_ mean?

`Dr. Stokes suggested to me that _nomena_ is simply an instance of our Celts having made _nomen_ into a feminine; and he adds that the Latin _agnomen_, when taken into Irish, was also treated as a feminine.  This, I think, is the most probable interpretation, and RINACI NOMENA would accordingly mean _The Name of Rinac_, which proves an exact parallel to the formula of certain Ogam inscriptions occurring in Ireland.  They usually begin with the word _amn_, followed by the genitive of the deceased person''s name; and _anm_ represents an early Goidelic form, _anmen_, which in modern Irish is _ainm_, ``a name''''.  It happens that none of these _anm_ inscriptions can be proved to belong to the oldest class of Ogams; but there seems to be no reason to suppose that the formula is not ancient.''

If _nomena_ could be regarded as a local by-form of the Abl. _nomine_ (cf. _ILCV_, i, nos. 1542 (_nomene_), 2133 (_nominae_, Abl.)), the present inscription would be strictly analogous to No. 279.''"|0|rcaps||"Rhys/1876, 105--106, `fairly good Roman capitals.

Westwood/1886, 45--52, `Now in usual conjunction with the Greek contraction, xps of the name of Christ, we find the Greek, or rather Graeco-Latin, form of the name of Jesus...contracted first into IHS or IHC or IHS and subsequently into ihs (which also form the initials of the words `Iesus hominum Salvator'', adopted as the motto of the Jesuits); and we accordingly arrive at the conclusion that the latter half of the newly discovered part of the Gurmarc inscription represents the ihs.

`Moreover, in many very ancient stones and MSS. we also find the names of Jesus Christ accompanied by the Alpha and Omega, according to the passage in the first chapter of the Revelations, v, 8. Here then we find, first, the capital A of the ancient form, for Alpha; second, a mark which corresponds with the well-known 7-shaped contraction in MSS. of the word _et_ (and), and then a letter which represents the ancient double vv form of the Omega (w) instead of the more ancient form ([capital Omega ={O}]). We, therefore, thus obtain the formula, Alpha et Omega, ihs and xps 

`The introduction of the initials of the names of the Saviour, or of the Alpha and Omega, at the top of Christian inscriptions appears to have been an evident imitation of the ancient Roman formula, D.M. (_diis manibus_), applied in similar situations. It is of the greatest rarity in our Christian lapidary monuments, and there is no other instance of the employment of the Alpha and Omega in conjunction with the ihs and xps in Wales than the one now found. In Ireland, one instance of such conjoined forms only is known, which has been published in the Journal of the Royal Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland (vol. iv, Fourth Series, Jan. 1883, No. 53, p. 43), found during some works at Glendalough in 1875, of which the preceding is a drawing; from which it will be seen that the ihr xps are preceded by two characters which the author, the Rev. James Graves, gives, together with the three others, as being in almost pure Greek characters, and as representing {A} and {W}, and as belonging to the eighth or ninth century (p. 44), `whilst the archaic form of the Omega would seem to point to even an earlier date.'' This letter is combined above with the contraction[1] for _et_; and when separated from this contraction it is, as here used, carved in many third and fourth century inscriptions in the Catacombs at Rome.[2]
 
The Bishop of Limerick remarks on this Glendalough Stone: `I have not met with an example that I can recollect of the use of the form of Omega, which occurs on this slab of Bresal, at a period more recent than the fourth century. I saw one instance of about that date on a Christian monument in Africa; but we must remember that ecclesiastical fashions of all kinds esta-

`[1] `Dean Reeves reads it thus, `et {w}'', and not as a simple {w}. The T~ is equal to ET, and so...equal to  `et {w}''. The line marking the contraction is seen above.'' (Footnote, p. 44.)

`[2] The Benedictines give numerous instances of the introduction of the A and {w} upon coins, diplomas, charters (especially at the headings), etc., in the Nouv. Traite de Diplomatique, vol. ii, pp. 569, 582, 616, and elsewhere. In vol. iii, P1. 37, v, i, they also give a representation, from a MS. of sermons of St. Augustine, etc., of the seventh or eighth century (which afterwards became common) of a cross from the arms of which are suspended the two letters A and w.

`Established themselves at a later period, and continued to prevail down to a later date in Ireland, than in Rome or other places to the east of us. As the Omega you have found on the Glendalough slab seems to be unique, I dare say you are right in regarding it as copied from a Greek MS. which happened to be in the hands of the ecclesiastics living there.'' (Op. cit., p. 47.)

`In The Book of Armagh, a famous MS. in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy, the passage from the Apocalypse reads, ``Ego sum alfa et {w}''''; and in the Codex, A. 4, 15, in Trinity College, Dublin, Library, there is a drawing with a {chi-rho}w, the middle monogram representing the contraction xpi; the {chi} being here formed by a horizontal bar crossing the upright stroke of the cross, which was a frequent form of the Chi; whilst the Rho appears above the bar, and the I is formed of the lower part of the vertical stroke of the cross. This is the real meaning of the {P | T} so that it is not equivalent to xps, as stated by the author (p. 46) and by most other writers. In such cases the prefix IN NOMINE (Christi) is understood, especially at the beginning of early charters.

Westwood/1886, 44--45: `The newly found portion of the inscription is difficult to decipher, owing to the peculiar forms of the letters and the partial abrasion of the stone. It commences with a large capital A with a long straight bar across the top of the letter, and the middle cross-bar angulated like a small V. This is an early, well known form of the first letter of the alphabet, and it is followed by an angulated stroke with a slight, recurved stroke at its bottom; which, however, may possibly be the bottom of the second stroke of the initial A. Then follow three upright strokes looped together at the bottom, like a small m turned upside down (w). This is followed by a single straight stroke, I; and then there is a broken space caused by the partial scaling oil of the surface of the stone, but in which may be very faintly traced the form of an h; and then there is clearly a large S, agreeing with the terminal S of the right upper angle of the stone.''

The probabilities are in my opinion in favour of the superior antiquity of the Ogham. The story of the stone looks like this; that it was erected as a memorial over some well-known chief of the invading Gaedhal, who for a long period occupied South Wales, and that at some period after, when the language of the Gaedhal, and the use of the Ogham were dying out, some patriotic descendant of the hero, to perpetuate the memorial, re-cut the inscription in the Roman characters then in use; the monument is of great antiquity, the Roman inscription alone on the authority of Mr. Westwood being referable to a date `not long after the departure of the Romans.''

Rhys considers this stone to be an example of `accentual hexameter'' (Rhys/1905, 34).

Macalister/1922, 301--302, notes that comparatively more women are mentioned on Welsh stones that Irish stones, and that this stone is one of the examples.

Macalister/1922a. 32: `Some have supposed an ellipsis of POSVIT [Stone] of E, son of D: C, his mother [set it up].  This seems unnatural, however; it would not be obvious, even to the contemporaries of the persons concerned, that such was the intention.  The simplest, and I believe in every way the best, interpretation is arrived at by regarding the second and third lines as a later addition.

`The stone was first set up to commemorate Evalos, son of Dencuos.  Accordingly, his name was cut in one line, running symmetrically down the middle of the stone as though no other inscription had been intended.   When, at some later time Cuniovende died, her memorial was added in the vacant space between Evalos''s epitaph and the edge of the stone.  The stone [wa]s still recognised as Evalos''s; therefore while his name is in the genitive, hers is in the nominative.  It is as though we construed it ``Stone of E.; here lies also C.''''  It is impossible to determine whether the word EIVS belongs to Evalos or Dencuos.  Perhaps the balance of probability inclines to the latter; it seems psychologically more natural that the two inscriptions should be drawn up with the same person in genitive relationship.  At least in such a modern inscription as ``Here lies Thomas, son of John Smith ... also Mary, his mother,'''' we should naturally refer ``his'''' to John, rather than to Thomas.   Had Cuniovende been wife of Dencuos and mother of Evalos we should have expected ``uxor eius'''' rather than ``mater eius.'''' ''

Macalister/1945, 431, `The first of the three lines of the inscription runs down the central axis of the inscribed face, and must be taken as the original legend.  The other three words are in two lines, squeezed in at the side, and certainly added later, as the result of a subsequent death in the family.  The lettering would have been laid out differently, and most likely the formula would have differed to some extent, had the inscription been cut all at one time. Cuniovenda was probably mother of Evalus, and presumably wife of Dencuus; but as the inscription stands it is not clearly defined wo whom _eius_ refers.''

As to reading C instead of his O, I am not certain, and even Q might be possible.''

`EVALI FILI DENO 
`CVNI OVENDE

`In the first line the letter O seems to be the last in it, because the sinking away of the surface with an edge running across the stone is evidently older than the letters themselves, and hence Mr. H. L. Jones was inclined to think the word to which this letter belongs was contained [continued] in the second line...The V and A in the first line and the V N of the second line are conjoined in the usual manner. 

`Professor Rhys (Arch. Camb., 1874, p. 332) considers the last portion of the first line to read DENCV{I}, adding, `At any rate Mr. Llywareh Reynolds, of Jesus College, Oxford, who assisted me in the inspection of this stone, agreed with me that there can be no doubt as to the V{I}, which Mr. Longueville Jones had missed. As to reading C instead of his O, I am not certain, and even Q might be possible.'' And in his Lectures (Pembrokeshire List, No. 73) he adopts the reading as Dencui, and the whole of the second line as one word.''

Rhys/1897, 330--331, `Mr. Edward Owen...rather shook my confidence, as he read the first line EVALI FILI DENOV{I}.  To understand the difference it is necessary to mention that between the C and the V there is a sort of step across a part of the face of the stone, so that the letters V{I} are on a lower level than the preceding ones; and if I remember rightly, they do not appear in the version in the _Lapidarium Walliae_ (pl.52, fig 2).  Now the C ends on the step I have mentioned, and the edge of the step is uneven and probably a little damaged of old.   So here comes the uncertainty whether one is to read C or O; but in favour of the former I may observe, that it would be very similar in shape to the C in the name _Cuniovende_.  Other points worthy of notice in connection with this inscription are, that the V of DENCV{I} and of EIVS has its second arm curved...and that in the former instance the first arm is also curved to a slight extent.  Lastly, the V of EVALI forms a conjoint character with the A, but the L is a separate letter in this case.''

Rhys/1905, 34, `There is a doubt as to the first O, since it is imperfect, but the last time I looked at it I thought it too nearly a complete circle to be a _C_, to which I had been in the habit of giving the preference.''

Rhys/1918, 188, `A sketch of the _Evali_ inscription at Spittal, which Mr. Allen reads EVALI FILI DENO | CVNIOVENDE | MATER EIUS, that is, with the ligatures resolved...I read it differently, for I take his first O to be C, and near it comes a small step beginning a slightly lower level of the surface.  Beyond that little step I found the letters V{I}; that is, the reading would be DENCVI, which as _De~n-cu~-_ I should equate with a Mediaeval Irishman''s name _Díanchú_. Philologically _Deno_ looks rather intractable, _Denovi_ would perhaps be less so; but no consideration of that order can be allowed to rule the reading.  The stone must be examined again.[1]

`[1] Since the above was written I have, thanks to Mr. Henry Owen and his motor car, had another opportunity of looking carefully at the stone.  We came at once to the conclusion that nobody had any excuse for omitting the V{I}, since, in spite of the little step in the surface, the V begins very close to the top of the C.  The only point on which there could possibly be a doubt is whether instead of the C in question we should read O; my own view is that the C is practically certain.  When we returned to Poyston we looked up Mr. Allen''s list [RomillyAllen/1896]...and found that he had by that time convinced himself that the reading of the name was DENCV{I}.''

Rhys/1881, 217--219: `I made it a point to visit the old stone, and to my gratification I found that the Roman inscription was no mere imagination of mine, but that it could be traced along the perpendicular diameter of the cross...Now at the top of the diameter of the cross, near the top of the stone, the inscription begins with a capital G of the usual reaping-hook form, followed by a faint E.  The rest of the diameter cannot be read until one comes near its lower end, where the man''s name clearly ends with a horizontal I preceded by L.  These letters evidently form part of the same name which we have in the Ogam; but I noticed that somewhat beneath and behind the L there was something like a horizontal stroke which I could not account for.  After leaving the stone it occurred to me that it might be the remains of a previous L, in the bosom of which the one still perfect was cut ...

`_Postscript.---I paid a second visit to the stone last June, when when I failed to find the L suggested above as possibly preceding the L{I}.''

Rhys/1897, 326--327, `I understood him also to agree with me in reading at the top of the stone the letter G, followed by a faint E, and forming the beginning of the name GENDI[L?]L{I} which I thought I had detected on a former visit.[2]  But there can be no doubt that the name was there in full in Latin letters, and possibly also that of the deceased''s father, before the cross was carved, not to mention later things on this ancient monument[1]''.

`[2] On comparing the photograph with my rubbing, I think there is no doubt about the sickle-shaped G, which is on the top arm of the cross, nor about the final I which is on the bottom arm of the cross near the right edge, and is placed vertical.  There are very faint traces of the E after the G and the L before the I.  The Latin inscription thus appears to be slightly askew, and runs from the centre of the top arm of the cross towards the second R in the name `Harries''.  The cross and the ogams overlap in such a way that it is not easy top say for certain which was cut first, but as the Latin letters are obliterated by the cross, the most natural assumption is that the cross is of more recent date than the oghams and the Latin inscription.  The form of the cross is an early one, and it is probably pre-Norman.---Ed.

During the meeting of the `Cambrians'' at Haverford West in 1897 a party of us visited Steynton, and I understood Mr. Allen to agree with me as to the beginning of the legend GENDI[L?]L{I}.  But the stone was so covered with hard lichen that the lettering does not appear in the photograph taken at the time by Mr. Mansel Franklen.  _See Arch.

Since Mr. Mansel Franklen photographed the stone, the Squire of Poyston has had it placed in the church, where the lichen must have died and become removable.

`[2] By a lapsus calami (easily detected on an inspection of the engraving of the inscription published with my article on this stone in the Archaeologia Cambrensis. here reproduced in the accompanying Plate II. fig. 3), the first word of the inscription was printed MACARIN{I} instead of MACARITIN{I}.''

Macalister/1930, 424, `The inscription has been read by everyone, since Westwood, MACARITINI FILI BERIC[I], the initial MA being a ligature formed thus--- {M/A}. After careful examination of the inscription on two occasions, however, I have satisfied myself that this ligature should be ignored, and that the name is simply CARITINI. In front of the C there is a character like A, which is certainly a modern addition to the inscription (extending the word ``modern'''' backward to include the time of Lhwyd, for the mark was there when he tried to read the writing). It is in a different technique (punched, not rubbed) from the rest of the letters. Between it and the C there is a quite natural triangular flaw in the surface of the stone, which makes the second half of the supposed monogram.

`But further, it seems to have escaped notice that there was at one time a second line of writing on the stone. The tops of three letters are left---insufficient for a restoration of the text, but at least worth putting on record. These are: a C, underneath (or, having regard to the normal upright position of the stone, to the right of) the horizontal I of CARITIN{I}; an A, underneath the monogram FI of FILI, and an L or an I, underneath the monogram LI of the same word.

`There is a very good photograph of the Neath stone in Arch. Camb., 1920, p. 371 (bottom of picture). The letters CARITINI, with the spurious M before it, and the FI of FILI (the first letter with its upright stroke curving backward at the bottom) following it, are quite legible; the rest of the inscription, however, is in obscurity. The curve of the C of the second line of writing, to which attention is now called, is perfectly clear in this photograph, just underneath the NI of the principal name.''

The existing line is badly flawed; the lettering is of the usual roughly-made Roman capitals...In front of the initial C there is a mark like {upside-down V}, which is certainly no part of the inscription, though it was there in Lhuyd''s time.  It is punched, not rubbed like the rest of the letters.  Between it and the C there is a triangular flaw on the surface of the stone: these two marks are erroneously combined in previous copies to make a ligatured MA, but they should be ignored.  The loss of the final letter (a horizontal I, preceded by a second C if Lhuyd is to be trusted) is probably to be placed to the account of Lady Mackworth''s emissaries, and perhaps the mutilation of the side of the stone "|SVNSS/1/1

From a rubbing of the stone made by Professor Rhys, reduced in the accompanying figure, it appears very doubtful whether there be any horizontal cross-bar in the second and fourth letters of the second line, whence Professor Rhys suggests (Arch. Camb., 1877, p. 139) that the inscription is simply POTENINA MVLIIER, the V being upside-down, the N''s formed the wrong way, and the H of the second word being merely two II''s.''

Macalister/1945, 340--341, `The T and the E''s are half-uncial : the other letters are capitals.  Three N''s are reversed.  The first N has been erroneously taken as a ligature of NT, owing to a crack (really part of a natural cleavage plane) crossing the dexter apex : there is certainly no trace of a T, either lligatured to, or following the N.  The upper triangle of the A is scaled, but the bed of the cross-stroke can be traced along almost its whole length, rather high up in the letter.  The second letter of the second line has, on the other hand, no cross-stoke ; it must be read as an inverted  V, not as an A.  The reading MVLIIER is certain ; it is evidently a misspelling of MULIER.

`The husband''s name occupied the third line, but nothing is left except the top of a C (or a sickle-shaped G) running across the two adjacent tips of the M{V},  and giving at first sight the effect of an L-like serif to the dexter limb of the {V}.  Fot the greater part of the surviving portion of this letter only the upper edge remains.  This is curved, so that it cannot be the top of a T or G (g), and is not sufficiently sloped upward to make the typical e of the stone.  C or sickle G are, therefore,  the only possible letters.  Underneath the {V} is another curved edge, a part of the upper outline of a curved letter, which, after C or G, could be hardly anything but O.  After this there comes a series of apices, and by a process of exclusion we arrive at the letters which they appear to indicate : see the diagram.

Jones/1862, 222: `The letters on this stone at Capel Brithdir are of a debased Roman character, passing into minuscules, and closely resembling those of the CATAMANVS inscription at Llangadwaladr in Anglesey.  Whatever date Dr. Petrie assigns to that, may be accepted, within certain limits, as the same for this stone. The character used for A, which is thoroughly barbarous in form, is nearly the same on both stones ; at least, the similarity is sufficient to lead to the supposition of contemporaneous execution. The letter R occurs twice in this inscription, and is also very debased, for it assumes the form, so widely different from the Roman type, which is found on other Welsh stones and in some MSS. down to as late a period as the thirteenth century. The letter M here takes the minuscule character ; and N, with the cross-stroke intended to be horizontal, is also debased. The form of G is commonly met with on other Welsh stones, and it resembles that of the Fardel stone from Devonshire, but departs rather more widely from the original and normal character of that letter. There are two forms for S on this stone, not at all resembling each other: the first that occurs approaching the shape, which it is found retaining down to the tenth century ; the second still preserving some trace of the old Roman type. Two letters were much injured, the first being U, at the beginning of the third line, of which only the lower portion remains, the other being I, at the end of the same line, which, though certainly there, is so faint as to have almost led to a doubt in the critical mind of Mr. Stephens.

`[Robert Vaughan] wrote it:

`_Hic in tumulo iacet Eporeus qui homo XRianus fuit_

`He gives no translation of this, but he intends to make it clear by writing R instead of P that this letter is not Latin but Greek, and that we have here chi and rho forming the monogram for CHRISTOS with a Latin ending _-ianus_, meaning `He was a Christian man''..."|n|rcaps||"Nash-Williams/1950, 174: `Roman capitals, thinly incised, with one three-letter ligature. The space between the first two words in l. 3, with faint traces of a bar above, has led to the conjecture that the second word originally read XPIANVS, i.e. _Christianus_. But the reading PLANVS seems certain.''

Gresham/1985, 386--??: `... in a notebook belonging to Edward Lhwyd ... His drawing ... is crucial to the argument .... The name _Porius_ and the whole of the second line of the inscription reading _hic in tumulo iacit_ were thus exactly the same then as now on the stone itself, and it is only the last line that requires further attention.  Lhwyd''s notebook is dated 1698 and at that time he read and wrote down the words _homo pianus fuit_.

`Lewis Morris visited the site and afterwards made the following note on a page of his printed copy of Geoffrey of 
Monmouth''s _Gesta Regum Britanniae_: `In Mr. E. Llwyd''s notes on Camden''s _Britannia_, p. 662, there is a mistake in the inscription which he reads _Porius hic in tumulo iacit Homo ... Rianus fuit._  But the inscription is not _Rianus_ but _Pianus fuit_, as I copied it myself, 1742.''  Later ... Thomas Pennant ... also published the last line as being HOMO PIANUS FVIT ... H. Longueville Jones ... also reads HOMO PIANVSFVIT.

`... Rhys [initially] ... accepted Longueville Jones''s reading, as did Hübner as well as Westwood ... 

`... Archdeacon Thomas ... found to his surprise that `instead of the accepted XPIANVS, it appeared to me to be simply PLANVS, whatever the meaning of that word might be''.  This met with `considerable incredulity'' and was only accepted later at the Annual Meeting at Bala in August, when an accurate drawing of the stone was made, showing the letters as they are at present.  There must also have been considerable discussion about this remarkable change in the lettering, but nno details of this are given, only the Archdeacon''s conclusion that `the foot of the L is not any recent addition.  It is of the same smoothness of incision and date as the rest of the letter.''  It was not until 1896 that John Rhys finally got to the site and accepted PLANVS as an original word.

`It is unlikely that Archdeacon Thomas and his fellow Cambrians knew of the drawing of the inscription made by Lhwyd in the late seventeenth century; if they had done they might have come to a different decision.  To accept the letter L in PLANVS had been there always in the past, just as it is today, is to imply that four distinguished antiquaries---Edward Lhwyd, Lewis Morris, Thomas Pennant, and Longueville Jones---were one and all quite incapable of reading a prefectly clearly written inscription in Roman capitals.  I am of the opinion that the documentary evidence makes it certain that the letter I in PIANVS was altered into an L at some date between 1846, when Longueville Jones made his rubbing, and 1884 when Archdeacon Thomas came to look at the stone.

`However, there is not only the documentary evidence to go on, but also the visible evidence of the stone itself.  On this point I asked Mr. J. M. Lewis of the National Museum of Wales to examine the stone with the possibility in mind that the inscrription had been interfered with.  This he has done, and has kindly allowed me to quote his findings.   He considers that there has been some interference with the original inscription at the beginning of the word _planus_, pointing out:

`(1) that this is the only place in the inscription where a space has been left between words;

`(2) that the horizontal line above the P in fact begins above the space to the left, which seems to show that this space once contained a letter, and that this line is a symbol of contraction;

`(3) that the horizontal bar of the L in _planus_ is thinner than the upright, this and the form of the letter being in marked contrast with the other L in the inscription;

`(4) that the surface of the stone between O and P appears to have been lowered by about a quarter of an inch, and bears some oblique and vertical scratches, as does the space between P and L. (In the bottom right-hand corner of the stone are lightly scored initials WV, which may or may not be related.)

`... When the photography and more particularly the rubbings of the inscription are compared with the drawings made by Lhwyd and Longueville Jones, it becomes reasonably clear that in its original state the foot of the letter I ended exactly on a line with the foor of the A carved closely next to it, and that the upright of the letter I has since been extended downwards by a distance of approximately a quarter of an inch so as to enable a narrow foot to be added to the letter converting it into a L.  Had the L been part of the original inscription its foot would have been level with the foot of the A, and the clumsy makeshift by which the foot is placed below the A should surely have alerted the Archdeacon and his friends to the fact that an alteration recently be"|TRAWS/1/1

If the reading of the fifth letter in the first line is correct, the uncial and Insular forms of the letter appear side by side; the concurrent use of two forms is common in Insular majiscule MSS.  The last letter in the line is incomplete, with only the rounded back remaining; a capital E of rounded form is likely.  The reconstruction of the base of the letters FIL at the beginning of the second line is conjectural; no trace of the second I of this word remains.  A few of the letters have forked serifs [cf. WRHAM/1/1].  Both the D and the Q show a slight shallowing of the groove, almost a gap, between the upright and the loop; this feature may be compared with the treatment of the cross arms in a number of Welsh crosses, which there is reason to attribute to the 7th century.

`The closest parallel in Insular epigraphy is the rather later inscription at Llanlleonfel which should belong linguistically to the later 8th century [Nash-Williams/1950, no. 62].  Both inscriptions have the same tendency to square letter-forms; both use the Insular N, the Q with a loop and long shaft, and the square U.  But Lllanlleonfel uses the uncial D while Wareham prefers the Insular form.  The tendency to separate the different parts of the same letter may also be noted at Llanlleonfel.  In Insular epigraphy the forked serif occurs occasionally as late as the early 9th century, _e.g._ on the Caldey Island stone [Nash-Williams/1950, no. 301]. In Wales the square U is found in the latest inscriptions of group I (5th--7th centuries); the Insular N is first used in group II (7th--9th centuries).''"|WRHAM/2/1

The Latinized _macus_ for late Primitive Irish _*maqqas_ from older _*maqqos_ would seem to show the change of _q_ to _k_ before a back vowel, and _Maqui_ the preservation of _q_ before a front vowel.  Hitherto there has been reason to think the former took place in or by the first half of the sixth century, whereas before a front vowel _q_ may not have become _k_ until towards the end of that century, a distinction which is quite natural phonetically and is strikingly paralleled in the history of Vulgar Latin.  Lastly _Coline_, which is on the face of it an error for _Colini_, calls for two linguistic comments.  First, it does not yet show the vowel change which would have been expected to turn it into Culini at some time in the later part of the fifth century; and second, it has _-e_ for _-i_.  If this last is not simply a mistake, it may be that at about this time final long vowels unprotected by a final consonant were already beginning to becone shortened and indistinct, a development which is a forerunner of the total loss of certain final syllables about 500 mentioned above; and the local engraver employed, not an Irishman and not knowing the language but hearing Cunorix's heirs say something like _kol'in'I_, took this last sound for an _e_, as a speaker of Latin naturally would, and therefore used E, probably thinking the form was a feminine genitive of the Latin first declension if he thought about it at all.'|n|rcaps|-1|Wright/Jackson/1968, 299: `Epigraphically, the lettering is crude Roman monumental capitals, pecked, not chisel-cut, markedly different from the `official' Roman inscriptions of the Empire period, though the  Ravenscar inscription, with its debased capitals,  belonging most probably to the year 407, is a (very untypical) `official' inscription which is not at all unlike it.  In fact, the lettering of the Wroxeter stone is indistinguishable from that of the earliest series of post-Roman `inscriptiones Christianae' of the West, dated by Nash-Williams between the first half of the fifth century and the middle of the sixth, before the intrusion of any uncial forms.  That the Cunorix inscription could well be as late as the early part of the sixth century, on purely epigraphic grounds, is shown by Nash-Williams's nos. 104 (Justinus securely dated 540), 138 (Vorteporix, very probably about 550) and 139 (Paulinus, perhaps about the same date).
