TRAWS|1|first mentioned|1698|E. Lhwyd|"Gresham/1985, 386--89: `The earliest drawing of the stone and its inscription comes from the end of the seventeenth century in a notebook belonging to Edward Lhwyd, who in person visited the site to make his record [Lhwyd/1910, 84, 89].  His drawing is reproduced here...Lhwyd''s notebook is dated 1698...

`Some fifty years later Lewis Morris visited the site...Later in the same century Thomas Pennant saw the stone and he also published [it] ... Then in July 1846 H. Longueville Jones came to the site, made a rubbing of the inscription, and published a drawing from this in the first number of _Arch. Camb._ ...

`At some unspecified date in the third quarter on the nineteenth century John Rhys approached _Bedd Porius_ but was driven away by a downpour of rain before he could read the inscription, so when writing about it he accepted Longueville Jones''s reading as, did Huebner as well as Westwood in his _Lapidarium Walliae_...

`The next authority to visit the site was Archdeacon Thomas, who was there on 4 June 1884 and published his findings in _Arch. Camb._ the following year...It was not until 1896 that John Rhys finally got to the site...

`Before considering the date of and reason for the alteration that has been made to this inscription it will be helpful to say something more about the original situation of the stone, its position being by no means certain.  Edward Lhwyd not unnaturally gives the earliest written information, and he wrote in his notebook as follows:

`Ye field wherin this stone lies is call''d maes y bedh in
`Trawsvynydh parish.  Within two fields of this stone is
`llech Idris (in ye same parish) pitch''d on end.
`The tenement wherin both stand is call''d Llech Idris from ye stone

`When Pennant visited the site a hundred years later he worded his description so badly that it is generally considered that he saw the stone kept inside a local farmhouse because he starts his paragraph with the words `In a farm-house, not far from the road to _Rhiw Goch_, I visited _Bedh Porus_ ...''.  However, his next  sentence shows that he should have written `At a farm-house...'' or `Near a farm-house...'', because he continues `On a flat stone over it is the following inscription...''.  This shows that by _Bedh Porus_ he means some form of grave on which the stone was lying loose and not preserved inside a house.

`A final pieces of information comes from Longueville Jones, who visited the site in 1846.  He records that some years previously W. W. E. Wynne of Peniarth (1801--80), a very distinguished antiquary of his period, having come to see the stone found the farmer in the act of building it into a wall.  He informed the landowner of Lllech Idris farm, Sir Watkins Williams Wynn, and as a result Sir Robert Williams Vaughan (1768--1843) of the neighbouring estate of Nannau made arrangements on behalf of the Wynnstay estate for the stone to be preserved in a small enclosure.  It remained there until 1933 when it was removed to the National Musuem of Wales in Cardiff for safety because all the surrounding land had been sold by the Wynnstay estate in 1906 as an artillery firing range that remained in use for some forty years.  The enclosure provided, where there is a cast of the stone, is some fifty yards in front of the place marked Maes-y-bedd on the Ordnance maps from which it is said locally that it was moved.  This could be where both Lhwyd and Pennant saw the stone, but since they seem to imply that it was lying loose on the ground it is not necessarily the site of the original grave.  The Ordnance maps record the modern site as _Bedd Porus_ as the instructions to the surveyors included advice to use local pronunciations and that in use here is _Bedd Porws_.  No doubt the use of the letter v posed a problem, and _Porws_ make a better Welsh name that does _Porivs_.''

The stone was selected and inscribed with a Gaedhelic inscription, as usual, on the angle, and leaving a space at the broad end of about 16 inches to secure it in the ground; subsequently a Roman inscription, embodying a portion of the Gaedhelic one, was inscribed on the stone as it stood, from thee top downwards, as we find the custom in all such examples, after which the cross was engraved on the broad part and the stone reversed.''

`In order to follow up these unsatisfactory data, I paid a visit to Tresco Island on 9 July 1929.

But the publication of my notes in AC (1929 : 191) led to the satisfactory result of inaugurating a search for the missing stone by Major Dorrien-Smith, proprietor of the island ; and in 1937 he discovered it.''

`The upper portion of one face bears a Maltese cross within a subcircular frame, with a short stem pendant from the frame.  The cross is formed by 4 sunken panels which are separated from the intervening panels in false relief by narrow grooves, 1cm wide x 1.5cm deep.  Beneath this design, on either side of the stem, is a saltire crosslet, that on the left being a plain linear cross, that on the right have slightly expanded terminals.  Directly beneath the stem of the main cross is a tunic-clad human figure.  A head, upstanding hair (or halo?), 2 eyes, and a mouth are faintly visible.  Even more faint is a diamond-decorated tunic, from which stick like arms and legs protrude.  The arms appear to bend at the elbows towards the body, and the feet turn outwards in opposing directions.  A spiral and chevron design runs down either side of the face from below the main cross to below the human figure where the designs are linked by a C-curve which runs across the width of the stone.

`The upper part of the opposite face bears a Greek cross with widely-expanded terminals; within the lower terminal is a very slightly raised triangle.  Beneath the right terminal is a plain, equal-armed crosslet, and a plain linear crosslet also occurs between the left terminal of the main cross and the edge of the stone.  Beneath the crosses, a triple, figure of 8 knot spans the width of the stone.  The single strand from which the design is formed swings upwards and downwards at opposite ends of the design, and then runs across the width of the stone framing the figure of eights above and below.

SDOGM|1|first mentioned|1694|Gibson's Camden|"Rhys/1873, 5, `Aug. 15.---We set out in the morning from Cardigan, and called at St. Dogmael''s, the other side of the river, to see the bilingual stone of Sagramnus''.

Jones/1860, 128, `Within the precinct''s of the abbey of St. Dogmael''s...Not only as a gate-post, however, but also as a bridge, has it been made serviceable to the daily wants of generations now dead and gone; for it was so used over a brook not far from its present locality, and had acquired a sort of preternatural reputation...It was perhaps fortunate, perhaps, that this should  have been the case, for the superstitious feeling of the neighbours not only tended to preserve it from injury,---no man or woman touched it willingly after dark,---but this very tradition, added to its peculiar form, probably led to its ultimate rescue.

`A gentleman who is the present owner of the property on which St. Dogmael''s Abbey stands, the Rev. H. J. Vincent, vicar of that parish, found the stone covered with a thick coat of whitewash, in a wall adjoining his house, where it was perhaps placed after its removal from the brook.  When the wall was taken down, with the view of effecting some improvements, the stone fell, and was unfortunately broken in two.  It was then carefully conveyed to the spot where it now rests, Before it fell its inscribed face and edge were uninjured.  Luckily they had been turned downwards by whoever placed it, ignorance of its value, across the brook.

`The inscription had been previously known; for that exact observer, Edward Lhwyd, had drawn the lettered surface most carefully, and his original sketch still exists.  He also remarked on some of the notches on the edge, and recorded a few in his drawing, but had not said anything about them in any of his notes.  His sketch was not known to exist until 1859, when it was found, by the writer of this paper, at Oxford. But several years previously the writer has ascertained that one edge of the stone was covered in oghamic characters, such as he had discovered at the same period on stones in other parts of the same district, and he pointed them out to Mr. Vincent, who at once perceived their archaeological value.  For several subsequent years he took careful drawings and rubbings of this stone, communicating them at the same time to Professor Graves of Trinity College, Dublin, and to Mr. Westwood.  The former, who has made the study of Oghams almost his own peculiar science, but his skill in working out the occult alphabet ...at once read off these Oghamic strokes according to the system previously arranged from Irish monuments of the same description, and found that it corresponded very nearly with the inscription found on the face of the stone.

`We say _very nearly_, for one important mark, equivalent to _a_, was apparently wanting; if that were found, the professor''s alphabet and theory would be completely correct.  He therefore advised the writer to re-examine the stone more minutely; this was done, and the professor''s conjecture was found to be correct : but more of this hereafter.  Professor Graves then declared this stone to be the equivalent of the famous Rosetta stone of the Egyptian hieroglyphic discoveries, because it contained the same inscription in two distinct characters, one of Romano-British type, the other of that occult Oghamic class which has been so much controverted, so much theorized upon, and so little understood.''  Passages of the above were cited _verbatim_ by Rolt Brash (Brash/1869, 155--156).

Westwood/1879, 215, `This stone has acquired a celebrity from having been the first discovered in Wales on which the debased Latin inscription was repeated in Celtic in Ogham characters, and having thence been `considered by Professor Graves, the first authority on the subject, to be as valuable a key to the latter mode of writing as the Rosetta stone was to Egyptian hieroglyphics.'' The stone was first made known by the Rev. H. Longueville Jones at the Rhyl Meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1858 (Arch. Camb., 1858, p. 461). The stone was long used as a foot-bridge at St. Dogmael''s Abbey, and is recorded by W. Gambold in Gibson''s Camden, p. 638 (Gough''s Camden, ii. p. 522 ; Ed. 2, iii. 152) ...

`In 1858 the stone was standing in a wall adjoining the Vicarage of St. Dogmael''s, but on taking down the wall the stone fell and was broken into two pieces, as shown in the figure. The stone had about the end of the seventeenth century been examined and sketched by Edward Lhwyd, the antiquary, who had marked several of the Oghams in his original unpublished sketch, still preserved at Oxford...At the Meeting of the Archaeological Association at Cardigan the stone was Visited, and the Rev. H. J. Vincent of St. Dogmael''s, one of the local secretaries for Cardiganshire, undertook the fixing of the stone in the interior of the parish church or some other equally secure situation. (H. L. J. in Arch. Camb., 1860, p. 136.)

CISP: [MH] the stone remains in this position."|pillp|"Jones/1860, 128--129: `a long narrow slab of porphyritic greenstone, such as found on the ridge of the Preseleu Hills, semi-columnar in form, and rhomboidal in section.  It is about 7 feet in length, tapering upwards from rather more than 12 to 9 inches in breadth, with an average thickness of about 7 inches.  The surfaces are all smooth, without any lichen adhering to them ; and did not other stones of this kind from the same hills offer the same appearence, it might be supposed to have been once artificially polished.  Such, however, is not the case; this particular kind of igneous rock does not decompose readily; its greenish base, and the dull white, squarish crystals with which it is filled, resist the effects of weather and vegetation with remarkable pertinacity.  The stone in question is probably in as sound condition, with certain exceptions, as when it was first brought down from the native hills.

`Stones of this kind are prized all over Pembrokeshire, from the circumstance of their peculiar form and hardness making them useful as gate-posts; every farmer is glad to get them from Preseleu; and the very stone of which we are now treating shows, by two holes drilled into its surface, that it has been made to do this piece of agricultural duty in worse times, archaeologically speaking, than the present.''

The lower limb of the cross is smaller than the others, resting on a square base, also ornamented with an interlaced design, the ribbon being double in four of the interlacements, so as to give a more symmetrical idea to the figure.

BRYNK|1|recognised|1902|unknown|"The stone was brought to the attention of Rhys in 1902 by Mr. R. Pritchard Evans, but none of the reports mentioned exactly who first noticed the inscription revealed when the stone was moved---it was possibly the tennant farmer who had moved it, Evan Jones (Rhys/1903, 255--256---see below).  All the earliest photographs (e.g. Anon/1903, 289, Rhys/1903, 257) show the stone with the text horizontal at the top, but when Rhys first saw the stone it was set on the present right-hand edge, where the ogham inscription is (Rhys/1907, 97). Before publication of the stone, it was moved again and the photographs taken, but  the ogham is not visible in these pictures (Rhys/1903, 258).  In 1904, during a visit of the Cambrian association (Anon/1904, 149), the `Venerable Archdeacon Thomas'' noticed the ogham (Rhys/1907, 97).  Rhys managed to visit the stone again in September 1904 by which time it had been moved once more to the farm-house (Rhys/1907, 97).

Rhys/1903, 256, `The stone may be said now to be a gate post, except that there is no date there; in fact it forms the end of a hedge where a gate or hurdle might be set up.  The farmer found it at a spot not far off, which he showed us; it lay flat with one of its corners protruding inconveniently near a gap in the hedge.  So he undertook to remove it, but he was surprised to find it so large and heavy, and when he got it clear he thought it would do for the unsafe position where I saw it, so he had it placed on a sledge and moved thither without any damage, so far as he knows, occuring to it.''

On the side of the ring, and in the middle, is a broad projecting fillet... a detail not found on any other example.
 All four sides are deeply sculptured, as follows:--
 Front.--- On the head are remains of knotwork similar to that on the back, but formed of a single instead of a double bead.  Unfortunately, the Stafford knots on the left and lower limbs have nearly disappeared.  The shaft is divided into three panels.  That at the top is inscribed in Saxon miniscules...In the middle panel is a curious interlaced knot, which is much worn in the centre.  The lower panel is much longer than those above, and contains irregular, broken, six-cord plaitwork, with an intervening space between the knots, the whole being very coarsely executed.
   `Left side.--- On the head, and the end of the arm, is a figure-of-eight knot, irregularly terminated at the top.  On the shaft is a continuous panel of interlaced work.  It commences at the top with a three-cord plait, one band of which stops abruptly against another near the bottom.  The other two cords are carried on, and twist, and, the crossings being emphasised by a ring, form a very clear example of the twist-and-ring pattern.
   `Back.--- On the head is a central boss.  Each limb is ornamented with a double-beaded Stafford knot, with the outer bands crossed over at the angle next the central boss and joined to the knots on the arm at either side, thus forming a complete and beautiful interlaced knot.  The only similar instance of this treatment is on No. 4 cross, Sancreed.  On the shaft is a continuous panel of very bold, foliated. and rather squarely formed scrollwork, having a leaf alternately with a ball in the spandrils.  On the main, or outside bead of each scroll, and close to where they bifurcate, is what is probably intended for, and is termed in botany, a `bract,'' or kind of cup, a very common detail in classical ornament.
   `Right side.--- On the head, at the end of the arm, is a Z-shaped key pattern, which might otherwise be looked upon as a pair of twisted bands.  The shaft is divided into two panels of uneven depth, and contains two entirely different patterns.  The upper panel is the shorter, and has a square key pattern, but unlike that on the head, and formed by [interlocking] T''s thus : [figure omitted].  The ornament in the lower panel consists of a debased form of chains and rings.
   `This is `a very peculiar pattern which occurs in Great Britain only in the Isle of Man and adjacent parts of Cumberland and Anglesea.  As the stones in this district are partly Scandinavian, and the same ornament occurs on a rune-inscribed font at Gallstad Church, Westgotland, and is not found on any other of the purely Celtic stones or manuscripts, this design may be fairly said to be of Scandinavian origin.''  [J. R. Allen]
   `Note.--- The Z-shaped key pattern or twist, above referred to occurs also at Gulval and Minister, in Cornwall, at Kirkby Wharfe, in the north of England, and in Scotland and Invergowrie, Kilkerran, Benvie, Liberton, and St. Andrews.''

The east side of the stone has been incorrectly figured both by Fenton[1] and Donovan[2]. Of the west side, containing the still undeciphered inscription, a careful figure was given by myself in the Journal of the Archaeological Institute in 1846, vol. iii. p. 71.''

Like No. 360, the monument is of special interest as one of the largest and most elaborate of the Welsh crosses, as well as one of the best preserved. The form represents the culminating development of the composite slab-cross, represented elsewhere in S. Wales, by Nos. 159, 222, and 360, to which the present cross stands in close stylistic relationship. Like most of the larger and later Welsh crosses, the monument is characterized by its faulty proportions, the tiny head being clumsily perched on top of a disproportionately tall and wide shaft. It thus lacks at once the slender grace of the best of the Anglian monuments. and the massive shapeliness of the Irish `high crosses''. The decoration comprises a limited range of patterns -broken plaits and knot- work, T-frets, and swastika and diaper key-patterns-of Celtic type but showing indirect Scandinavian influence (looped pattern); the execution is fairly good, but is characterized by coarseness and irregularity, a tendency that becomes increasingly marked in all the later S. Wales crosses. These features combine with the use of late details-ring-twist, looped knotwork, and pellets to place this monument somewhat later than No. 159, and more or less contemporary with No. 360.''"|complete|good|Nash-Williams/1950, 184,  states that this is `one of the best preserved' of the Welsh crosses.|converted|4.11|visible|1.27|actual|0.33|actual|Nash-Williams/1950|13|6|visible|4|2|actual|1|1|actual||4|"Westwood/1879, 119--120, `On the west side (which has been more weathered) the design is nearly defaced, although a small portion of a ribbon-interlacement can be observed on this side.

The middle portion on this side has a modification of the curious Chinese pattern, in parts of which the sculptor had made several mistakes in the carving. This design, which also appears on the south and east sides of the Nevern cross (Plate LXII), is in fast a slight modification of a series of filfot crosses united together by straight raised connecting bars.

Lhuyd may himself have visited Clydai; but at any rate one of his assistants who reached the place took a sketch of the inscription, and this sketch, or a copy of it, passed at Lhuyd''s death in 1709 to Mr. John Anstis, in whose collection, now at the British Museum, it has been preserved.  The sketch is extremely rude, and is evidently the work of one who had been told to be a faithful copyist of the letters and markings that he saw upon the stone, but who was not equal to a drawing of the cross...At the moment of going to press another sketch of the third Clydai stone has been discovered amongst the Anstis collection of Lhuyd drawings.

The present stone (numbered 12 by Macalister, _CIIC_), is still in reach, however.

The arms of the cross-head (Plate 25) on both E. and W. faces (the upper arm-end much eroded) have plain edge-mouldings forming panels filled with double-beaded triquetra-knots, all linked on the hub around a central bead; on the sides each panelled arm-end contains a four-lobe twist. The surviving stump of the ring has traces of edge-moulding framing possibly a row of pellets. Both E. and W. faces of the neck have a panel framed by plain edge-moulding containing double-beaded six-cord plaitwork in three regular loops; the N. and S. panels each have a three-lobe twist.

`The enlarged collar at the head of the shaft, chamfered on its upper surface around the mortice, is much weathered and lacks most of its N. edge. On each face upper and lower mouldings frame a row of boldly moulded pellets or balls, one at each angle and three between them. The decoration of the shaft has been largely obliterated by weathering and by possible re-dressing of the face. On the E. face are four vertical panels framed by plain edge-moulding (the side mouldings removed by the cutting of the chamfered angles) with a blank space below them; the upper three panels show traces of diagonal key-patterns and the lowest slightly larger panel shows possible knotwork. The S. face has four panels similarly spaced containing traces of straight fret-patterns including T- frets;[3] below the panels the shaft is plain. The W. face has traces of vertical panels not aligned to the other faces but the patterns are indecipherable. The N. face has one continuous band of six-cord plaitwork with possible horizontal breaks. The remainder of the shaft below the fracture is plain, as is also the whole of the base.

`[3] The reading of an inscription in two horizontal lines in the top panel (Arch. Camb., 1899, p. 164) cannot be reconciled with the evidence for the decorative pattern of frets, and was no doubt influenced by the name `Ebissar'' appearing on the cross-shaft at Coychurch (No. 935)."|f|COYCH/2

Camden|"Rolt-Brash/1871, 158--162: `Being desirous of making a personal examination of the Ogham inscribed stones of Wales, I was enabled to gratify my curiousity in the autumn of the past year... On my visit to that place, I found the greatest difficulty in finding its whereabouts... [for] it had been removed from the place of its original location, stated to be on the farm of Ty yn y wlad, off the road between Crickhowel and Lanbehr, to Glenusk Park, the residence of Sir Joseph Bailey, M.P., about two miles from Crickhowel.  Proceeding to that place, I had the satisfaction of seeing it at last, standing about half way up the avenue, on the right hand-side, under a clump of trees...

`Having written to Sir Joseph Bailey some inquiries respecting the removal of the monument, he has kindly sent me the following information, that the stone was not on the farm of Ty yn y wlad, as stated by Jones and others, but on a farm of his own called Wern y Butler, adjoining the former; that it was placed as a foot-stone across a ditch, and in that position was entirely neglected, and hourly subjected to injury.  Seeing the archaeological value of the monument, and its precarious and neglected position, he considered it prudent to place it in a position of safety by removing it to Glenusk Park''.

Westwood/1876, 73--4: `In 1846 I visited the farm of Wern-y-Butler, where the stone then was, and it was impossible to have discovered it had I not been accompanied by the proprietor of the farm, as it was completely overgrown with brambles, and the plough having cast earth up around it on which grass and moss had grown in profusion.  The stone had even then been removed from its former position in an adjoining field on the farm of Ty-yn-y-wlâd. ...

`About ten years ago the stone was removed from its former situation to Glan Usk Park, the residence of Sir Joseph Bailey, M.P., about two miles west of Crickhowell, where it now stands in the midst of a small clump of trees about three furlongs to the east of his house, and where it was visited by the members of the Cambrian Archaeological Association at the Brecon Meeting in 1872, and again at the Abergavenny Meeting in 1876, when they were most hospitably received by Sir Joseph Bailey.''

The bottom panel contains an eclectic jumble - the paschal lamb and flag, David rending the jaws of a bear, and two other animals one apparently carrying a pole or flag. The middle panel consists of a central ring containing a circular interlace knot...surrounded by four pairs of birds, legs and beaks crossed and interlaced...The top panel on the reverse of the shaft, which contains a single mounted warrior, seems to parallel the text panel, and it is tempting to imagine it contains a representation of the king mentioned in the inscription. In the elongated middle panel are four foot-soldiers wearing tunics and head-gear, armed with round shield and spears. A thin border of key pattern divides this panel from the possible remains of a hunt scene with pouncing dog below. Two foot-soldiers, similar but more embellished than those on the back, occupy the middle panel of the south side. Above them is a pair of opposing beasts on hind legs, fore-legs intertwined sitting on their haunches facing each other with their paws crossed over on each other's necks, and below them a simple triquetra knot. On the north side the top panel is taken up with a beast biting its own tail which is interlaced beneath its body. The bottom has an interlace knot of six-cord plait with a single break in the middle, and in the middle is a remarkably well-preserved figure, possibly David, seated in an ornate chair, singing and playing a large harp. The cross-head is separated from the shaft by a thick border around all four faces above which there is a marked step in of the silhouette. The edges of the head are surrounded by a roll-moulding (single spiral curves at each of the points of the cusped hollows between the arms). The four `arms'...are of equal size but the top panel has been elongated by the addition of a further panel...On each face the cross-head forms a single field of ornament. On the back are two stems of vine-scroll foliage, arranged in simple spirals and interlace, on the front interalce knots in a cruciform pattern around the central boss, and beyond that on each arm, spirals. In the centre of the cross on both faces there is a large circular boss surrounded by a sort of ribbed border.

`EAST FACE (Figs. 247--258)

Shaft (Fig. 249)
Plinth: Due to its heavily worn condition, the subject matter of the plinth is difficult to ascertain. On the left there is what could be the head of a ringed cross on a possible shaft, or a lamb with a ringed head, but the nature of the small ring on the right is more enigmatic. In the centre there  may be a human figure flanked by an animal or a bird, or it could be two centaurs face to face, but identification is very uncertain.
E1: THE RAISED CHRIST( Fig. 922)...
E2: a panel of interlace forming circular devices.
E3: THE SACRIFICE OF ISAAC (Fig. 680)...

Head(Figs. 248 and 939)
Centre: (?)THE LAST JUDGEMENT (Figs. 248 and 939)...
South arm: DAVID PLAYING THE LYRE (Figs. 939)...
North arm: DAVID SLAYS THE LION(Figs. 939)...
Top: A square panel has a rounded boss in each corner, on one of which interlaced decoration is preserved. Emerging from them are some animals which bite one another in the centre, and others with their heads on the outer periphery of the bosses. Above this panel is a roof, decorated with an imitation of shingles.
The ring: The ring has roll mouldings at the edges, framing panels of animal interlace in the lower left  and upper right segments, and fretwork with spiral terminations in the lower right segment. The nature of the decoration in the upper left segment is not clear. Attached to the inner surface of the ring are the cylinders, the ends of which are decorated with a round boss surrounded by a circle of pellet decoration.

SOUTH SIDE (Figs. 250-253)
Shaft (Figs. 250 and 251)
Plinth: On the plinth, two winged animals are seen in profile, contorting the neck so that the head is almost frontal. The animals stand opposite one another under a tree. The right-hand animal seems to be grasp the stem of the tree with its right front paw.
S1: EVE GIVES THE APPLE TO ADAM...
S2: CAIN SLAYS ABEL (FiG. 670)...
S3: DAVID AS KING (Fig. 250)...

Head (Figs. 251--253)
Underside of ring: Snake and heads (Figs. 253)...
End of arm (Fig. 252) The end of the arm is in the shape of a truncated pyramid, with cushion moulding above and below, and having raised ribs on the sides and top of the pyramid. The central panel bears a fretwork pattern.
Upper side of ring (Fig. 252).-There is probably an interlace pattern on the left side.
Top: A Horseman (Fig. 252).-A horseman proceeding to the left, and with the head of the horse in front of the roll of moulding of the frame. The decoration in the triangular area above it, and on the finial at the top, is too worn to be identified.

WEST FACE (Figs. 254--256)
Shaft (Fig. 255)
Plinth: Inscription.-The plinth bears a fragmentary inscription...

W1: CHRIST IN THE TOMB...
W2: THE MOCKING OR FLAGELLATION OF CHRIST...
W3: THE SOLDIERS CASTING LOTS FOR CHRIST''S GARMENTS...

Centre: THE CRUCIFIXION (Fig. 870)...
North arm: THE DENIAL OF SAINT PETER (Fig. 870)...
South arm: PILATE WASHES HIS HANDS (Fig. 870)...
Top: TRADITIO CLAVIUM...
The ring: The ring has roll mouldings at the edges, and attached to its inner surface are the cylinders decorated in a similar fashion to those on the east face (Fig. 248). The upper left and lower right segments have raised bosses linked in the form of S-spirals; the bottom left has animal interlace as has also probably the upper right segment as well.

NORTH SIDE (Figs. 257-258)
Shaft (Figs. 258 and 784)
Plinth: Inscription.-The plinth bears a fragmentary inscription...
N1: (?) ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST EMBRACING/ RECOGNISING CHRIST (Fig. 784. bottom)...

N3: ZACHARIAS AND ELIZABETH WITH THE INFANT JOHN THE BAPTIST(Fig. 784, top)...

Head (Fig. 257)
Underside of ring: Similar to the south side (Fig. 253).
End of arm: Similar to the end of the south arm (Fig. 252), except that the central panel is decorated with interlace.
Upper side of ring: No decoration visible.
Top: An unidentified seated figure with hands, palm outwards, falling down by the side. Above, in the triangular gable of the roof, there is a boss-whirl out of which three serpent-like animals emerge. There are knots of three-pointed interlace in the intervening spaces''.

`The sculptured face is so badly weathered that at first sight it seems absolutely impossible to make out the ornament.  The decipherment offered on the accompanying Plate is the result of a microscopic examination of every square centimetre of the face of the cross---a task that occupied the better part of two days, followed by four days spent over a number of rubbings.  Even with every care, I cannot feel sure that I have made out the whole pattern beyond the possibility of cavil; the stone is too far gone to allow anyone that satisfaction.  The most doubtful part is the central pattern of spirals.  The spirals are there, though they have to be very carefully looked for; the fret in the middle is also fairly distinct.  But when it comes to linking the spirals up, one with another, the would-be decipherer is confronted with ambiguities between which he must be content to choose the most probable.

`The panel on the sinister side of the base remains intact, but that on the dexter side is almost entirely lost;  and the small portion that remains is not sufficient to tell us what device it bore.  The remaining panel bears in rather high _cavo rilievo_ the figure of an animal, from whose mouth depends the leg of a man.

Westwood/1879, 19, `This stone stands upon the grass-sward at the side of the road, supposed to be identical with the Via Julia Maritima, between Kenfig (Kenfegge or Kenfyg) and Margam, near the Pyle Station, without any protection. It is called by the peasantry of the neighbourhood Bêdh Morgan Morganwg, i . e. the sepulchre of Prince Morgan...This stone was first noticed by Bishop Francis Godwin, Bishop of Llandaff, in a letter to Camden, preserved among the Cottonian MSS. in the British Museum (Julius F. vi. fol. 282), and published by Camden, ed. vi. p. 499.[1]...The inscription,'' says Gibson (Camden, ii. p. 23), is now in the same place and is called by the common people Bêdh Morgan Morganwg, viz, the sepulchre of Prince Morgan, who was slain, as they would have it, 800 yeeres before Christ''s nativity, which whatever gave occasion to it, is doubtless an erroneous tradition, but antiquaries know full well that these characters and formes of letters be of a farre later date, it being no other than the tomb stone of one Pompeius Carantorius.''

`EAST FACE (Figs. 404, 405, 409)
Base (Fig. 409)
Lower Step: The `riser'' has rows of stepped crosses with sunken centres.
Upper Step: The `riser'' has decoration which is much worn, but in the left-hand half there would appear to be a man sticking out his arm in the midst of birds and other animals.
Shaft (Fig. 404)
Above the plinth with incised line running parallel to the edges, there are three patterns of marigold type, which can also be seen as two full and two half circles. There is a small three-pointed knot of interlace in the intervening spaces above and below, while the centre of the ''upper'' circle has four T-shapes forming a square, probably imitating metalwork enamel designs.

Head (Fig. 405)
At the centre of the head there is a large domed boss with radiating lines (petals?). Beneath it is interlace, from each side of which emerges a serpent which stretches its head with upturned snout into the arms the cross. There it crosses the neck of, and bites the lower jaws of, another serpent which emerges from a spiral above the central boss. On the top of the cross there is an animal with body and forward-stretching legs seen from above, and a face shown with both sides towards the front and with a curled-up snout.
Ring: The bottom right segment has interlace between a raised roll moulding, and the bottom-left segment has rope-moulding. But the other details of the ring are not clear.

SOUTH SIDE (Figs. 406-407)
Base
Lower Step: The lower step is divided into three seperate panels, that on the left with a broad interlace. The other two are too weathered to be recognisable.
Upper Step: While difficult to interpret due to weathering, the ''riser'' of the upper step would seem to have on the left a cross-shaped panel possibly bearing a human interlace surrounding a sunken cross within it, and on the right perhaps interlace motifs.

Cross
On the plinth, there is a roundel decorated with interlace (Fig. 406). Vertical mouldings on the shaft divide it into three upright panels, of which that in the centre has a simple broad-banded interlace which turns into running spirals under the arm, yet reverts to interlace at the top of the shaft.

End of arm: NOAH''S ARK (Fig. 407)...

WEST FACE (Figs. 410-412)
Base (Fig. 410)
Lower Step: This is divided into a number of panels, of which that in the centre has two crosses in false relief sharing one common arm, and bearing lozenge-shaped or spiral decoration. To the left is a panel of interlace forming a cross-shape. The panel on the extreme left has interlinked squares with sunken centres. The decoration of the other panels cannot be made out satisfactorily.
Upper Step: Three groups of two bosses, probably with spiral and trumpet decoration between them.

Shaft (Fig. 411)
Plinth: Inscription (?)(Fig. 410).- The plinth has a rectangular panel surrounded by a raised rib. Little or nothing is visible on the panel today. It may, however, have once borne an inscription...

W 1: A panel of diagonal fretwork (Fig. 411)
W 2: A panel of vertically-structured fretwork with diagonal lines interspersed (Fig. 411).

Head(Fig. 412)
Below centre: GOD BLESSES AND SANCTIFIES THE SEVENTH DAY (Figs. 412 and 650)...
Above centre: (?)ADAM AND EVE AT LABOUR (Fig. 412, and 662)...
Top: Interlinked squares with sunken centres, giving postive or negative cross-patterns.

NORTH SIDE (Fig. 408)
Base
There is a stepped pattern in relief on the lower `riser'', probably with geometrical decoration in the back-ground, but the upper `riser'' shows no signs of decoration.

Cross
Above the plinth, which bears an incised line forming a rectangle, vertical ribs divide the shaft into three upright panels. The central panel has broad interlace which continues in a slightly different form under the ring, and reverts to the original pattern at the top of the shaft.
End of arm.
The end of the arm is divided into four squares, for which the following interpretations  may be put forward.
Top left: (?)ST JOHN THE BAPTIST EMBRACING/RECOGNISING CHRIST (Fig. 789)...
Top right: SALOME DANCES FOR THE HEAD OF JOHN THE BAPTIST (Fig. 789)...
Bottom left: THE NAMING OF JOHN THE BAPTIST(Fig. 789)...
Bottom right: ZACHARIAS AND ELIZABETH WITH THE INFANT JOHN THE BAPTIST (Fig. 789)...''.

The cross itself is decorated with weaving patterns, except for a blank panel half way down the shaft, and for the four points of the cross which are decorated with interlace.

If this is the remains of a cross shaft then it is of unprecedented shape...Below the rectangular figure there is incised a bird of prey, presumably an osprey, with its talons sunk into a fish.

There are crude crosses at the top, with a figure shaped like an egg-cup between them: and below is what might be a rude representation of a quadruped, having on its body the name GUADEN.

The decoration of this face as a whole is vaguely suggestive of a schematic anthropomorphic representation (? of ''Guadan the Bishop'' see below), with the ring-cross representing the head (? with eyes, moustaches, and mouth) and shoulders, and the inscribed panel below the (? robed) body.''

`The composite structure of this remarkable monument makes it unique among the Welsh crosses (but cf. No. 205). The form, however, is clearly related to that of the simple moulded pillar-cross represented by Nos. 47 and 65, while its decoration likewise employs the same repertory of simple plaits and knots, supplemented in this case by a single key-pattern and the use of figure-sculpture. The grotesque design of the monument illustrates the trend of the later S. Wales sculpture towards exaggerated and bizarre monumental forms combined with over-elaboration of ornament. In detail the monument is of interest for the `architectural'' treatment of the angle-mouldings, which are here developed into columnar forms complete with bases and capitals. The cross clearly belongs to the culminating phase of Welsh Early Christian sculpture.

`[1]The lower shaft has tenons, at both ends fitting into corresponding mortises in the pedestal and `knop'' respectively. The `knop'' also has a mortise on top to receive the tenon of the upper shaft.''

The moulded collar is stepped like an inverted capital but the plain necking on which it rests is the head of the lower shaft.

In Westwood''s time it stood: `In the churchyard of Llandevaelog-fach...[It] is built into the west wall of a small square building erected in the churchyard, a little south of the church, being a mausoleum of the former owners of Penoyre'' (Westwood/1876, 58). By the time Macalister was writing (Macalister/1949, 133) it was: `...standing against the Penoyre vault in the churchyard''.

The notice given in the _Archaeologia_ (vol. i) by Mr Strange is dated 1769, at which time, `it covered a low wall contiguous to the outside of the south wall of the church''. It seems from this statement to have served as a kind of coping stone.  It now stands fixed against the west wall of a mausoleum of the former owners of Penoyre''.

Westwood/1876, 58: `It may be described as consisting of four several compartments: (1) the top of the stone, being occupied by an incised ornamental cross, followed by (2) the figure of a warrior, whose right shoulder has been cut away with a portion of the stone, the figure being surrounded by interlaced ribbon-patterns; (3) a square space, bearing an inscription preceded by a cross; and (4) an oblong space, with a double interlaced ribbon-pattern, of which I believe the lower part is cut away...With the exception of the space containing the inscription, the letters of which are incised, the surface of the whole stone is sunk, leaving the ornamental patterns and figure in relief. The incisions forming the design are but of moderate depth, and it is therefore really surprising how well, in so exposed a situation, it has been preserved, withstanding the action of the elements for at least a thousand years.

The cross at the top of the stone is of the calvary form, formed of two parallel raised bands interlaced at the junction of the limbs, the ends of the limbs forming dilated triangular knots, the basal knot being increased in size to give greater apparent support by the band being doubled.

The spaces within the angles formed by the arms of the cross are filled in with interlaced ribbons, which are either doubled or trebled; the middle band of the lower left-hand space appears to have been left entire, instead of being trebled by incision, like the other ribbons in that part of the design.

The warrior in the next compartment is as rude an attempt at delineation as could well be imagined. It is 2 1/2 feet high, with a most ill-shaped head, and disproportionately large left shoulder and small legs. There is no attempt at rounding the limbs, the surface of the stone being left flat, and the parts indicated only by incised lines. In his right hand he bears a thick straight weapon resting on his right shoulder, but of which the upper end has been cut away; in his left hand he also bears a short weapon, slenderer than the other, and which is evidently extended into the ribbon-pattern at his left side. The pattern on the right side of the stone, at the side of the head, is a double interlaced ribbon, which is not quite regular in its lower part; the ornament on the lower part of the compartment to the right of the figure is a modification of the Z-pattern, which bears so great a resemblance to Chinese work. The left-hand side of the figure is occupied with a single interlaced ribbon-pattern, in which independent circles have been introduced to fill up the design. The square space below the figure is surrounded by a narrow cable-like moulding, the upper line being bent upwards, following the position of the feet...

`The bottom compartment is occupied by a bold diaper-pattern formed of double interlaced ribbons. The design is irregular at the top right-hand corner, and the bottom has apparently been cut off...

`The present stone is almost the only instance occurring in Wales of the figure of the deceased being represented on one of those early slabs, and is valuable, rude as it is, as affording some slight indication of the dress and weapons of a British warrior. It has struck me as possible that the sculptor of this stone might have been led to introduce the figure of the deceased warrior, from the circumstance of the Roman monument in the vicinity, commonly known under the name of the Maen y Morwynion, having full-length figures of the deceased and his wife sculptured upon it.''

`2. A rudely drawn figure of a warrior, clad in a kirtle reaching to his knees, and holding a spear and a short dagger.  On each side of the head there are interlacements.  A fragment, containing the shoulder of the figure and the head of the spear, as well as the interlacement, was already broken from the stone in 1769: it has since been replaced...On the dexter side of the lower part of the figure there is an interlacement, on the sinister side a key pattern.

The later, longer account was published in a festschrift originally, and then in Arch. Camb for 1913, and reproduced by the Royal Commission (RCAHMW/1925, 167--168).  Rhys''s ideas concerning the stone changed quite considerably in that time.  The stone was visited by The Royal Commission in 1920 (RCAHMW/1925, 167--68), and then by Macalister in 1921 during his `epigraphic tour'' (Macalister/1922b).

Rhys/1913, 384--385, `On the next day Dr. Owen motored me to Trehowel Farm, near Rhydowen Station, on the Whitland and Cardigan line of railway, to see an Ogam inscribed stone. We had with us Mr. James, the Pembrokeshire Director of Education : he acted as our guide, for his home is near Rhydowen ; and it was he who gave us the news of the discovery of the stone : that was so long ago as October, 1908. The discovery was due to Mr. Arthur O. Griffiths, of Glandwr, and Mr. Llewelyn James, brother to our Director of Education for the day. The discovery consisted in their noticing that a gate-post, near the farmhouse of Trehowel, bore traces of ancient markings and of the outlines of a cross. The stone had been there some thirty or thirty-five years unnoticed, but not undamaged by the wheels of the carts that from time to time passed in and passed out of the field. The history of the stone, so far as Mr. James could get it, was that it had been brought down there from a neighbouring farm called Yet Wen, from a spot on an exposed hill known as Mynydd Stambar. Near the stone were found, he was told, pieces of _crochanau_, which would seem to point to fragments of sepulchral urns, also traces of fire. He writes of the spot as a _lloc defaid_: after visiting it, I should describe it as a meeting of two fences at right angles where sheep can be cornered and caught. Mr. James was good enough to send me photographs which he had taken of the stone. At my request Mr. Eyre Evans visited Trehowel at the end of March, 1910, and took a rubbing and a copy of the inscription and cross. He also asked the tenant, Thomas Lewis, questions as to the removal of the stone to its present position. The reply was that he remembered the stone thirty-nine years before, and knew exactly the site on Mynydd Stambar. He added that he brought down two stones : one of them was standing and the other lying down close to it. This is likely to be correct, but when I cross-examined him on my visit there in October, 1910, he admitted that it was not he that brought the gatepost down. This was in answer to my question whether it was brought down in a cart or on a sledge, or else dragged by horses along. the ground, for I thought this latter method of removing the stone might account for some of the injuries to it. As to a second stone, he could tell me nothing ; he seemed to have forgotten all about it, and I am inclined to think that was not brought away at all, at any rate, not about the same time. At present there is no such stone visible on the site on Mynydd Stambar ; at all events, no stone of anything like the same dimensions as the inscribed gatepost... Mr. Eyre Evans had the hedge cleared away round the stone in quest of more writing, but he found none, either Goidelic or Latin.''

Cyril Fox examined the site and region in February 1943,  but the damage to the immediate site makes his observations provisional.  Fox then investigated the possibility that the stone, from what is now a remote area, was placed next to the line of the Roman road, and concluded that this was indeed a possibility.

`The under-side of the stone, as fixed in the top of the window at the time of my visit, exhibited a variety of patterns, chiefly of an interlacing character with a square cruciform design in the middle. Since my visit the stone has been rescued from its former position, and it has been found that the upper part of the design consists of a cross of the Latin form, each limb formed of three incised lines which are dilated at the ends, on either side of which is represented a human figure most rudely delineated, with raised arms and outspread fingers, as in the attitude of prayer, and a long shirt-like garment reaching down to the knees. The figure on the left side of the cross is smaller than the other on the right side, the latter of which has a large circle between the arm of the cross and the head of the figure, two smaller circles over the shoulders, and two upon the breasts of the figure, from each of which last mentioned circlets three small straight lines extend downwards. `At first sight,'' says Prof. Rhys, `they seem to stand under a cross, but I am not certain that it is not the apple_tree with Adam and Eve beneath it; at any rate, above the lady''s shoulders there are two or three small circles which may be an attempt at representing apples'' (Arch. Camb., 1874, p. 332). As a small part of the basal portion of this cross was visible whilst in its former situation, and closely resembled the same part of the Llandevailog cross (Pl. XXXIII. fig. 2), I felt satisfied that the whole represented a cross with figures of the Virgin Mary and St. John standing at its sides. ... I presume, notwithstanding the larger size of the figure on the right-hand side, that the peculiarities of the ornament over the shoulders and on the breasts indicate a female, and it is probable that a larger size was given to this figure in order to express a greater amount of reverence to the mother of the Redeemer than was due to St. John.''

Rhys/1905, 71: `On the face appears a Latin cross with figures, supposed by Westwood to represent the Virgin Mary and St. John standing beneath the arms of the cross...''

Macalister/1949, 137: `The designs  are pocked.

`On the face of the stone there is a cross with bifid ends to the arms : the part above the cross-arm is lost with the fracture of the stone.  Below the cross are two figures, male on the dexter, female on the sinister side.  Although they appear at first sight to be attired in tunics this may be merely a result of the barbaric drawing : for the figures are clearly nude, and are most probably meant for Adam and Eve.  The whole design, including the interlacements, illustrates an advanced artistic degradation.''

Nash-Williams/1950, 76--7: `The face and edges of the stone bear rudely picked decoration within cable-borders (mostly fractured away); the stone is also inscribed. _Front._ The upper part of the face is filled with a large combined outline and linear Latin cross. with bifid terminals, with incised motifs in the interspaces: (a) top l., wanting ; (b) top r., square key-pattern (R.A. 908, used also on Nos. 37-8) ; (c) bottom l., standing male figure, facing front clad in a long straight tunic, with arms upraised (_`orans''_) and holding a book (?) in the r. hand.

`This stone was first mentioned by Edward Lhwyd in Gibson''s Camden, p. 618. Strange, in the Archaeologia, vol. vi (1782), p. 22, pl. 2, fig. 1--2, gives a very insufficient engraving of it, copied in Gough''s Camden, iii. p. 130, pl. 7, fig. 2. In Hubner''s work (p. 22) an engraving is given of the inscription of the front of the stone in which the word `anmia'' is misprinted `anima,'' and with the m of the usual minuscule form.''

RomillyAllen/1889, 119, `The earliest notice of the Llantwit crosses occurs in Gibson''s edition of Camden''s _Britannia_ (1695), the additions to Wales for which work were contributed by Edward Lhwyd, the Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.  It is to this eminent antiquary, the pioneer of Welsh archaeology, that we are indebted for the first accurate knowledge of the inscribed stones.  The Llantwit crosses have also been described subsequently by Mr. Strange in the _Archaeologia_, vol.vi (1779), by Donovan in his South Wales (1805), by Mr E Williams, otherwise known as ``Iolo Morganwg'''', in the volumes published by the Welsh MSS. Society, and lastly by our old friend and associate, Prof. Westwood, in his standard work on the subject, the Lapidarium Walliae.''

The stone was eventually moved to its present position in the church in 1903 (Halliday/1903).  During this move, the complete outline of the cross was revealed (see form_notes).  A cist grave was discovered at the foot of the cross which was considered contemporary with the cross, and as evidence that the cross has been _in situ_ (Halliday/1903, 58--64).

RomillyAllen/1889, 125, `The last points we have to consider are the forms of the crosses and the character of the ornament.  The five sculptured monuments at Llantwit exhibit three different types; the wheel-cross, the rectangular cross-shaft, and the cylindrical pillar.  The crosses of Samson, Samuel, and Ebisar, and of Houelt, the son of Res, are of the so-called wheel shape, consisting of a tapering shaft of rectangular section, surmounted by a circular head, shaped like a drum.  The head of the first of these two crosses is lost, but the mortice-hole by which it was fixed on still remains; and the curve of the top enables us to conjecture that the diameter of the drum must have been about 3ft.6in. The mortice is double, the centre part being sunk 5 1/2in., leaving shoulders 2 in deep at each side. (See wood cut, p. 126.) The shaft is 6ft. 6in. high, 2 ft. 7in. by 1 ft at the bottom, tapering to 1ft. 11 in. by 8 1/2 in. at the top.

The worked portion of the stone terminates in a picker line, about 3/4 in. in breadth, a few inches below the ground line...There are no signs of either tooling or working in any form.  It is simply a glacial boulder turned to account: on one side the surface is rubbed quite smooth, and shows very distinct striations.''

`In the top of the shaft a rectangular mortice has been cut 11.4cm deep, countersunk with wide shoulders 6.4 cm deep, for a separate cross-head now lacking. This most probably took the form of a disc-head, for which there is some evidence in the deliberate concavity of the upper surface[1] and in that the decorative patterns on the narrow sides need to be completed by being continued on the sides of a head of similar width (_cf._ No. 911). Its size may be estimated by comparison with Nos. 903, 907 and 911 rather than from the degree of curvature of the surviving top surface...The form of the shaft and in particular its decorative patterns are very similar to those on the `Cross of Eiudon'' (E.C.M.W. 159), and the two stones may have been carved by the same hand.''"|complete|some|"Westwood/1879, 9--10, `The front face has unfortunately been much injured by the scaling off of large portions, nearly the upper half and a portion of the lower division having thus been lost, caused by the climbing of children up the stone.

The other edge of the stone has thirteen squares filled with a diagonal and square design.''

RomillyAllen/1889, 125--126, `The ornament on the Llantwit stones consists of interlaced and key-patterns arranged in panels of the same class as that found in the Irish MSS. of the ninth and tenth centuries.  There is none of the spiral decoration which is characteristic of the earlier MSS., sculptured crosses, and ecclesiastical metal work.

`Attention should be particularly directed to three peculiar patterns on the crosses of Samson, Samuel, and Ebisar,--- (1), two oval rigs interlaced crosswise; (2), four T''s placed in the shape of a fylfot or swastica; and (3) a simple key pattern.  Similar designs occur on three other crosses in Wales,--- at Golden Grove, Caermarthenshire; and at Nevern and Carew, Pembrokeshire.''

RCAHMW/1976, 50, `On the E. face (as when in situ and as now re-set) the decoration forms three main panels in vertical order within plain continuous angle-mouldings.

This circumstance proves that the other ancient inscribed stones [including this one] were not then to be seen. ...

`About the year 1730, as I am informed, Mr. Thomas Morgan, a schoolmaster at Llantwit, found an ancient cross of the same age and style of sculpture as that of Iltutus, in an old, ruinious place where tradition shows the places where seven churches are said to have been.  Possibly they might have been the chapels of so many separate colleges, or societies of monks, or students, which might have been the seven halls mentioned in the foregoing account of Mr. Nicholls by Sir Edward Stradling.  The ancient cross Mr. Thomas Morgan placed before the church door February 5th 1812; Henry Tucker, being clerk, had it carried into the old church.''

His figure of it, P1. III. fig. 6, is extraordinarily imperfect. Donovan gave a better figure in his Tour in Wales, i. p. 343, and plate annex.''

RomillyAllen/1889, 125, `The last points we have to consider are the forms of the crosses and the character of the ornament.  The five sculptured monuments at Llantwit exhibit three different types; the wheel-cross, the rectangular cross-shaft, and the cylindrical pillar.  The crosses of Samson, Samuel, and Ebisar, and of Houelt, the son of Res, are of the so-called wheel shape, consisting of a tapering shaft of rectangular section, surmounted by a circular head, shaped like a drum.''

Macalister/1949, 155, `A slab...It is cut into the shape of a cross with solid wheel, standing on a broad stem expanding downward.''

Nash-Williams/1950, 140, `Monolithic disk-headed slab-cross, with solid quadrate wheel-head[2] and splayed shaft. 72'" h. (overall, above butt) x 26'" w. at bottom tapering to 18'" at neck x 6'" t.; diam. of head, 32'"....The cross is decorated on both faces (? and originally on the edges) with carved patterns in low relief, and is also inscribed...the dating of the cross in the late 9th century ranks it with No. 363 as one of the earliest of the Welsh sculptured crosses. The close similarity of the flat calligraphic style of its decoration and of the motifs used to those of the almost contemporary Berechtuire slab at Tullylease, Co. Cork,[7] identify the monument as probably the work of an Irish or Irish-trained sculptor.

`[2] The stepped or `quadrate'' wheel-cross in the Greek (i.e. equal-armed) form is found five or six times in S. Wales (Nos. 147, 155, 220, 231 (?), 234, 263), three times at Clonmacnois (? only) in Ireland (see CMS, nos. 78, 85, 86), and perhaps only once elsewhere-at Clyne in Sutherlandshire (ECMS, iii, p. 51). The Latin form of the wheel-cross occurs more commonly-in Ireland again (at Clonmacnois and, as a free-standing `high cross'', dated 11th century, at Roscrea (LSI, ii, pl. 107)), and in E. Scotland (principally Forfarshire), but is apparently absent in England (including Cornwall) and the I. of Man. The stepped cross, both Greek and Latin, without the wheel, shows a broadly similar distribution. It is also found in the decoration of Celtic manuscripts, e.g. Lindisfarne Gospels and Gospels of St. Chad, both dated c. A.D. 700 (see Millar, The Lindisfarne Gospels, pls. and xxxviii). Presumably both forms, with and without wheel, originated (? in the manuscript decoration) in Ireland, the latter form in the 7th century. See also ASA, p. 109; OQA, fig. 76. Cf. No. 210 above.

RomillyAllen/1889, 125--126, `The ornament on the Llantwit stones consists of interlaced and key-patterns arranged in panels of the same class as that found in the Irish MSS. of the ninth and tenth centuries.  There is none of the spiral decoration which is characteristic of the earlier MSS., sculptured crosses, and ecclesiastical metal work...The key pattern occupying the whole of one face of the cross of Houelt, the son of Res, is one of the finest examples to be found anywhere.''''

Nash-Williams/1950, 140, `_Front._ The cross-head comprises five squares of swastika key-pattern (R.A. 995), linked by opposed T''s (R.A. 908), with four-lobed plain twists (R.A. 501) filling the arcs of the wheel and large double-beaded triquetra-knots (R.A. 798) in the interspaces. The shaft below is filled with a double vertical band of well-executed triangular fretwork (R.A. 979)[3] widening towards the bottom so as to fit the splayed face. Below the decoration is a Latin inscription... _Edges._ The edge of the disk-head, which alone remains intact, is filled with a narrow double band of slanted T-fret (cf. R.A. 906).[5] _Back._ The decoration of the head is the same as in front, except that the square panels of the cross are linked by straight, instead of oblique, opposed T''s. The decoration of the shaft is disposed vertically: (a) double band of triangular fret-pattern (R.A. 935, but with triple-line spirals); (b) double band of six-cord double-beaded knotwork (R.A. 601), based on the Stafford-knot, ending in loops above and below.[6] T

`[6] The use of free end-loops in interlacing was a Coptic feature. Cf. LSI, i, p. 96.''

RCAHMW/1976, 49--50, `On the E. face the disc-head is filled with a ringed cross potent within a narrow edge-moulding, the ring being flush with the arm-ends. The squared arm-ends and central square are formed of diaper key-pattern, the connecting arms of paired T-shapes linked to the outer squares only. Each arc of the ring forms a panel within plain edge-moulding, filled with a plain twist in four lobes incorporating single and double pellets. In each sunk inter-arm space is a double-beaded triquetra-knot distorted to fill the panel and incorporating pellets. The face of the shaft consists almost entirely of one splayed panel originally framed by bold angle-mouldings (of which stumps remain) and filled with a triangular key-pattern in two paired bands, incorporating pellets at the base. A Latin inscription (Plate 12) in five horizontal lines completed the face below this ...

`The more worn head and damaged shaft on the W. face are decorated much as the E. face. The disc-head has a similar ringed cross-potent differing only in that the diminutive arms between the squared centre and ends are formed of paired Greek frets. The shaft has two decorative panels, the upper one composed of a triangular key-pattern in double vertical band, looser than the similar design on the E. face; the lower panel, separated by a plain moulding, contains a pair of identical patterns of loose double-beaded knotwork, each consisting of a pair of Stafford knots joined by paired loops above and below.

LTWIT|3|first mentioned|1798|Morganwg, Iolo|"Iolo Morganwg, 1798, reproduced in RomillyAllen/1893, 326, 328--330, `I have already observed that the author of the additions to _Camden_ takes notice only of the monumental stone behind the church erected by Samson to the memory of Iltutus [LTWIT/2].  This circumstance proves that the other ancient inscribed stones [including this one] were not then to be seen...In the summer of 1798 I dug out of the ground in Llantwit churchyard a large monumental stone, and its history affords a remarkable instance of the fidelity of popular traditions.  About forty years ago a very old man, his name Richard Puntor, was then living at Lanmaes-juxta-Lantwit, who, though only a shoemaker, was a more intelligent man than most of his own class.  He had read history more than many, was something of an antiquary, and had stored his memory with a number of interesting popular traditions.  I was then about twelve or fourteen years of age; like him, fond of history and antiquities.  He one day showed me a spot on the east side of the porch of the old church at Lantwit, where he said a large monumental stone lay buried in the ground, with an inscription on it to the memory of two kings.  The tradition of the accident which buried it in the ground he gave as follows...[a similar account of the story is given by Donovan, quoted by Westwood, and is given below].

`After I had heard this traditional account I had a great desire to dig for this stone, and many times endeavoured to engage the attention of several, and their assistance; but my idea was always treated with ridicule.

`In the year 1789, being at work in Lantwit Church, and being one day unable to go on with my business for want of assistance, it being the height of the corn-harvest, and not a man to be found, I employed a great part of one evening in digging in search of this stone, and found it.  Evening brought the farmers and workmen home, and Mr. Chrisr. Wilkins and Mr. David Jones, two very respectable gentlemen farmers.  On seeing the stone they ordered their men to assist me.  We with difficulty got it out of the ground, and on it we found the following inscription ...

`It lay on the ground where it had been risen out of the grave, till Aug. 28, 1793, when I procured assistance to erect it against the east side of the porch, where it now stands.  It must have been buried in the ground before the continuator of Camden took a copy of the inscriptions on Iltutus etc.; otherwise he would certainly have copied this also, as he likewise would have the stone placed by Thomas Morgan, before the church door, had it been there.''

Rhys/1873, 9, `Aug. 30.---The rector kindly accompanied me to Llantwit-Major, where we knew there were several inscriptions.''

Westwood/1879, 12--13, `This tall quadrangular shaft in the middle of the last century stood in the churchyard, but in digging a grave near its base it fell into the hole,[1] where it lay till 1793, when it was raised and erected against the east side of the south porch of Llantwit Church, where it now stands.

`[1] Donovan gives the following details of this accident (Tour in S. Wales, i. 345) :---`Many years ago a tradition prevailed in this part of the country that a large sepulchral stone, which recorded the memory of two kings, had been accidentally buried in the grave of ``Will the Giant.'''' This was a young man, so called on account of his extraordinary stature, being 7 feet 7 inches in height when he died, although he had only then attained his seventeenth year. Will had desired to be interred near this stone, which then stood erect against the wall, but in preparing the grave of sufficient dimensions to admit his remains, the sexton incautiously dug so close to the foot of the stone, that just as the body was laid into the earth it gave way, and falling from the wall into the grave with prodigious violence, it was found impossible, or at least inconvenient at that time to remove it, the stone was therefore left in the position in which it fell, and the grave being filled up, it was completely covered over with earth. This transaction had taken place so long ago that the recollection of it bad nearly faded by degrees away. But Mr. Edward Williams, who resides at the village of Flemingstone, only a few miles from the spot remembered having heard the story when a boy, and proposed at some future day to search for the stone. An opportunity at length offered to this intelligent mason to gratify his curiosity, be began by clearing the ground in the spot described to him so many years before, and discovered it at a small depth below the surface, after which he obtained assistance to raise it from the earth and place it against the wall where it now stands.''

Like No. 206, it is distinguished by its ungainly proportions and a tendency towards coarseness and over-elaboration of ornament common to all the later S. Wales monuments.''

RCAHMW/1976, 46--47, `Both the cross and the base...have carved decoration in low relief, slightly weathered; the slab-cross, which also has an inscription on the head, has almost certainly been reversed in relation to the base.

`The head and shaft are formed of one stone 185cm tall but lacking at least 18cm broken off the foot of the shaft.[2] The disc-head is 107cm in diameter and 25--28cm in thickness; the shaft, 13cm thick, is 57cm wide but tapers slightly towards the foot...The rectangular base, 76cm high (67cm exposed), 202cm wide and varying in thickness from 63cm on the N. to 58cm on the S., is decorated on all four sides and on the upper surface. The socket, 50cm by 13cm...This slab-cross, probably erected either to mark the bounds of the monastic enclosure or serve as a focus for public prayer,[7] is the most impressive of the monuments of this category in the county, if not in all Wales.

`[2] Possibly with shaft originally as tall as head. The uncompleted sketch in Stowe MS. 1024, fo. 25, shows that this fracture had occurred before ca. 1690; according to R. Allen in Arch. Camb., 1899, pp. 15--16, the fractured end was re-fashioned to form a new tenon for the socketed base, which is unlikely to have been done after 1536.

All these compartments are filled in with elaborate interlaced raised ribbon-work of varied patterns, the spaces on each side of the stem or base of the cross having a figure of a man rudely sculptured, the one to the right wearing what looks like a cowl on his shoulders, and which in the other figure seems to cover the head. Above the head of each figure is the triquetra ornament. The open spaces between the arms of the cross have been left unornamented and flat (not being pierced through), and appear to have been inscribed with small letters.''

Following the making of casts of the Margam monument, during which the hunting scene on the back of the pedestal was discovered, Ward published an account and a further description of the form and decoration of the monument (Ward/1894, 250--253).

Macalister/1949, 158--159, `On its [the base] front are three panels of geometrical ornament, within a rope margin, and a guilloche.  On the back, two men on horseback pursue three animals, represented one over the other (a perspective device, as they are really intended to be one _behind_ the other).  On the dexter end there is an interlacement within a rope margin: on the sinister end a fret, with a strange un-Celtic looking row of rosettes...One third of the key-pattern on the base at the back has been broken away.  On the front of the slab there is an equilateral cross potent within a wheel: the surface of cross and wheel is covered with interlacements.

Flanking the panel to l. and r. and occupying the remainder of the shaft are two standing draped figures (incomplete) of St. John and the Blessed Virgin, with plain triquetra-knots (R.A. 485a) in the field above.[1] St. John (l.), facing front, is shown with moustache, beard (?), and long hair (? or hood), and clad in a loose robe falling in long folds, with the skirts (? or sleeve) caught up over the r. arm.[2] He clasps either a book (the Gospel) or a book-satchel before him. The Blessed Virgin (r.) is turned slightly towards the cross, with hands apparently clasped in front. She has long hair coiled at the sides, and wears a long robe loosely gathered in front to a collar round the neck and falling in folds below. The whole group---cross and flanking figures-is clearly intended to symbolize the Crucifixion.[3] _Back._ The head is filled as before with a quadrate wheel-cross (top half defaced by flaking) containing carved decoration: (a) bottom left-hand arc of wheel, serpentine twist (R.A. 501) and/or square fret[4] (R.A. 886); (b) bottom right-hand arc, plain two-cord twist (R.A. 501); (c) bottom arm of cross, plain double Stafford-knot (cf.

On the E. face or `front'', the decoration of the cross-head consists of double-beaded triquetra knots in the upper arms which in the lower member resolve into plain beading incorporating a single pellet, all linked around the central plain raised hub and double-beaded ring; the edge-moulding is also double-beaded. Below the straight lower edge the brief neck band is ribbed vertically. The face of the shaft forms a panel framed by double-beaded moulding and is entirely filled with a much-weathered Latin inscription...

`The narrow vertical panel on the S. side of the shaft is much weathered but has traces of a pattern of twists and frets, the lowest section forming a square of diagonal swastika key-pattern.

`The W. side of the cross-head has double-beaded edge-moulding, within which the arm-ends contain double-beaded triquetra-knots linked around the central damaged hub without ring. The neck-band has centrally a plain two-cord twist of four lobes set between vertical ribbing. The upper edge-moulding of the shaft has alternate bands of vertical and horizontal ribbing in contrast to the plain double-moulding on the E. side. Eight irregular panels of diagonal swastika key-patterns, framed and divided vertically by a double-beaded moulding, fill the face on the shaft. On the N. side, the arm-end of the cross shows traces of straight fretwork, while the neck is boldly ribbed vertically.

From a notice on this stone by Mr. G. E. Robinson of Cardiff, one of the Secretaries of the Cambrian Archaeological Association (Arch. Camb., 1876, p. 141), accompanied by a figure of the stone, it appears that the stone is now to be found within the private grounds of Gelli-Dywell mansion, about two miles from Newcastle-Emlyn, on the Carmarthenshire side of the Teify.''

The site was visted in August 1907 by Rhys, who was able to get `a mason to clear away patiently the mortar and stones alongside in the direction of the beginning [of the Ogham inscription], which in time he got clearly visible''.  Turning his attention to the Latin inscription Rhys guessed its termination but was `quite wrong; for as the stone was long and had an ample grip of the wall, the mason punched away until he had the under surface of the lintel clear well past the last letter, and the name completed itself''.  The Latin inscription made Rhys more curious about the Ogham and so `furter punching revealed the notches for _u_ ... It was impracticable to make a  hole further in that direction, or in  pursuit of the _Ma_ of _Maglocuni_ [in the Latin inscription] (Rhys/1907, 83--84).

Westwood/1879, 100--103, `The ornamentation of the four sides of this cross is of that kind to which the term Runic knots and circles has been perpetually misapplied. It is however not of Scandinavian but of Celtic origin, and is found in all the earliest Christian British and Irish monuments, both of stone and metal, as well as in MSS. That it does occur indeed on some stone monuments with Runic inscriptions in the Isle of Man and elsewhere is true, but it nowhere occurs in Scandinavia, nor in Teutonic countries, and therefore, as indeed historic records prove, its occurrence with Runic inscriptions is due to Scandinavian visitors adopting the ornamentation with the religion of the country they resorted to.

`It will be seen from the engraving that the shaft of the cross consists on each side of a series of compartments, each containing a differently arranged interlaced ribbon or other characteristic pattern; thus resembling the ornamented shaft of some of the gigantic initial letters in the early MSS. of the Gospels above alluded to, which may indeed be said almost truly to represent the shafts of these great crosses reduced to the size of a miniature, thus proving the identity of the workmanship as well as of the workmen by whom both classes of monuments were executed.

`Taking the representations of the Nevern cross as they occur in the accompanying plate, it will be seen that in addition to the endless variety of the interlaced ribbon patterns (each ribbon having an incised line running along its centre), the south side has at its base a raised pattern of classical design resembling the Grecian fret, of which a better specimen occurs at the top of the west side. Above this fret on the south side is a curious diagonal pattern formed of narrow raised and angulated lines, the general effect produced being that of a St. Andrew''s cross with the spaces between the arms filled in with four pairs of incised T''s placed obliquely, with the tops of each pair placed in opposition to each other. This is also the character of the bottom compartment on the east side, except that here only one-fourth of the pattern is represented, and consequently there is only one pair of T''s similarly placed, with raised knobs in the open spaces. It will be seen that if the pattern on the south side were to be doubled or quadrupled the oblique T''s would form a series of X''s, giving somewhat of the character of the curious pattern in the compartment on the east side above the inscription[1]. These diagonal patterns have very much of a Chinese character about them, as is also especially the case with the compartment above the inscription on the west side, and that at the bottom of the north side, where four T''s are so arranged as to form a series of steps in the spaces between the letters. The pattern at the bottom of the west side is another modification of these diagonal designs, and is of common occurrence on the Llantwit and other early decorated stones.

`The head of the cross is of elegant proportions, the four arms of equal size, short, widened at the ends, with the spaces between the arms sunk, the depressed parts with a raised boss in the centre of each, as is also the case with the centre of the cross itself, which is ornamented with an interlaced ribbon pattern, as is also the narrowed space at the base of the cross.

`[1] A curious error of the sculptor in this pattern will he noticed, the upper fil-fot cross having the angulated end of its left upper arm reversed. The ingenious manner in which the adjoining ornament has been modified will be observed.''

Westwood/1879, 118--119, `In the Journal of the Archaeological Institute, vol. i. Proceedings, p. 384, October, 1844, the late Albert Way, Esq., published two figures of two fragments of carved stones, which he regarded as portions of the same cross, and which were employed as jambs of the fire-place in the vestry ; these, by permission of the Vicar, were taken out...From a letter from Mr. J. Romilly Allen to myself, dated May 10, 1878, it appears that the inscribed fragment above described is no longer to be found at Penally; the other fragment still remaining at the rectory. I find however, in the account of the Tenby Meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1851 (Arch. Camb., 1851, p. 340), it is stated that the inscribed Penally stone was exhibited in the temporary museum at Tenby (it is not stated by whom), but in a preceding page, 338, it is stated that a rubbing of the same fragment was exhibited by Mrs. Gwynne. Is it possible that the inscribed fragment still remains at the Tenby Museum, or is it now in private hands? In either case, it ought to be restored, and fixed with the other fragment in the walls of Penally Church or elsewhere, so as not to hide the carving on both sides of the stones.''

Macalister/1949, 173, `At a meeting of the Cambrian Archaeeological Association, held at Tenby in August 1851, a loan collection of antiquities was exhibited, including: ``One of the crosses from Penally Churchyard, with an inscription.''''  It had previously been illustrated by Way in the Archaeological Institute''s _Journal_, where he describes how it and another carved stone were found, acting as the jambs of a fireplace in the church vestry.  After the exhibition in 1851 it appears that the stone was never seen again.''

PBRYN|1|first mentioned|1695|E. Lhwyd|"Westwood/1879, 146, `This stone was first noticed by Edward Lhwyd (Gibson''s Camden, p. 648, and ii. p. 42 ; Gough''s Camden, iii. p. 160), and was also subsequently engraved by Meyrick (Cardiganshire, P1. IV. fig. 2). From information received by me from H. Jenkins, Esq., and the Rev. John Hughes, Vicar of Penbryn, it appears that this stone formerly rested on the side of an artificial mound of stones in a field not far from the church of Penbryn, called Parc Carreg y Lluniau, on the Dyffryn Bern estate. On removing the tumulus (of which no trace now remains) an urn was found buried, but it was not ascertained what were its contents. The stone was afterwards set up in its present erect position as a rubbing-post for the cattle...It was visited by the members of the Cambrian Archaeological Association during the Cardigan Meeting, and was subsequently published by the Rev. H. L. Jones (Arch. Camb., 1861, p. 306)''.

Macalister/1945, 339, `In Lhuyd''s time this monument stood on a heap of stones which were cleared away, according to Meyrick, two years before he wrote (_i.e._, about 1806), when some silver coins and an urn containing ashes were found.  He tells us nothing about the nature of the coins found in such curious combination.''

Nash-Williams/1950, 102, `The stone was first recorded in the 1695 edition of Gibson''s Camden, where it is vaguely referred to as `a rude stone in Penbryn parish, not far from the Church''. Later references describe the stone as lying against a `heap of stones'' (cairn?) on or near its present position on the summit of a saddle-backed field formerly known as ''Parc Carreg y Lluniau''. Removal of the heap of stones[4] carried out about 1804 as a preliminary to re-erecting the stone brought to light ''an urn full of ashes, as well as a few bronze, silver and gold Roman coins of the time of Vespasian, which were presented...to Colchester Museum,[5] with the exception of a gold Vespasian...''. The `urn'', a small grey- ware olla of late 1st- or early-2nd-century A.D. type, and the `gold Vespasian'', actually an aureus of Titus (A.D. 79-8I), are now preserved in the National Museum of Wales (Accession Nos. 05-176 and 29.433/2).

`[4] Another account (in AC, 1862, p. 216) speaks of the removal of a ''windmill...in a very dilapidated condition''.

Note 1, `The Chi-Rho symbol (p. 15) apparently occurs on Early Christian monuments in Britain twelve times---five in Cornwall, two in Wales (the present stone and No. 106), one in Northumbria and four in W. Scotland. Two of the Cornish examples are in the early Constantinian (4th century A.D.) form ; all the others except that from Northumbria are in the `monogrammatic cross'' (5th century and later) form (as here). The Northumbrian example, in the Constantinian form and dated c. A.D. 685, is probably an antiquarian survival. The monogram also occurs on monuments in Ireland, where it ''is not as rare as is generally supposed''. The distribution as a whole is consistent with the view that Christian influences were infiltrating into the Celtic regions of Britain in the sub-Roman period direct from Gaul by way of the western seas (p. 4). See Hencken, Cornwall and Scilly, pp. 212 if. ; IBC, p. 99; NC, p. if.; ECMS, i, p. xvi; IA, p. 33; Antiquity, viii (1934), p.49 (Sir Alfred Clapham).''"|f|PMCH1/1

XIX, Fig. 1). Col. W. H. C. Llewellyn, the owner of the land, promptly informed the National Museum of Wales, and in due course generously presented the stone to the Museum, where it is now displayed in the archaeology galleries (Accession no. 68.454).

`The stone was found in the silted-up ditch along the north side of field no. 392 on O.S. 25-inch Sheet Glam. XL.3 (Nat. Grid. 21/887 811), outside the field-hank that divides it from Coed Ty-maen (Fig. 2). Mr. Parsons reports that its back was against the bank, and that it was leaning over on its side so that its top left-hand corner was Just below the surface of the ground. Thus it seems to have been partly buried in the ditch, its top being covered by slip from the bank.''

RCAHMW/1976, 54: Found in 1968...and subsequently deposited in the National Museum of Wales...Turned up by ploughing a field''."|in display|museum|National Museum of Wales|pilsc|"Lewis/1970, 71, `The stone is a block of local rhaetic sandstone, 1.27 m. high, 0.56 m. in maximum width and 0.21 m. thick. On the face of the upper, and widest part, is a carved cross formed of sunken panels...The butt is roughly pointed and was intended to be set in the ground to a depth of 0.38 m. The edges of the stone are dressed to shape, the top section narrowing sharply below the cross, then tapering to the point where it would have entered the ground. ...

`The form of the cross relates it to the group of `panelled cartwheel'' crosses defined by Nash-Williams (ECMW, p. 38) as `erect square- or round-headed slabs, some fairly massive, decorated on one or both faces with a partly sunk or panelled cross of ``Maltese'''' shape, with or without moulded edges and commonly enclosed in a raised ring or border giving a cartwheel-like effect.'' Eleven stones were assigned to this group,[1] though two of these,[2] while falling within the terms of the above definition, possess other strong characteristics that differentiate them. The addition of the Pen-y-fai stone therefore brings the total number of this closely related group to ten. As Nash-Williams pointed out, the group belongs to a limited area of south Glamorgan, being represented in the vicinity of Neath, Margam, and Merthyr Mawr. The Pen-y-fai stone, found within this area, serves to emphasize the local nature of the group, which probably represents, as Nash-Williams claimed, `the products of a local (? monastic) school (or schools)'' of the late tenth or eleventh century.

The arms of the cross are composed of four stirrup-shaped hollows, their curved ends towards the centre, having a maximum depth of 1.6 cm. The triangular interspaces are also sunken, but to a depth of less than a centimetre, so that the arms of the cross have greater emphasis. The centre of the cross, between the sunken arms and interspaces, is itself slightly hollowed, and contains, in its lower half and slightly left of centre, the faint trace of a circle. The ends of the cross-arms and interspaces are defined by a continous [sic.] pecked line that is no longer traceable round the whole of the design, being weathered away at the top of the stone. Outside this a second pecked line follows closely the curved outline of the cross, but the lower edge forms a rectangle, leaving triangular spaces between the lower interspaces and its corners. In each of these spaces is a ring-and-boss design. A third pecked line follows the cross round its upper three sides, but at its lower edge diverges to define a roughly rectangular panel 25 cm. deep, which occupies the lower part of the stone.''

It was found by Mr. Richard Alison in the garden of the farm-house lying among debris of various kinds.  No other inscribed stones were found with it.  However, in March 1963 the farm-house was rebuilt and the contractor, Mr. E. B. Hopper, then found five or six head stones containing markings outside the front door of the house.  They were lying flat, but Mr. Hooper spoke to someone who could remember them standing upright.  There were graves nearby with which Mr. Hooper assumed the stones were associated.  Accidentally the stones were then used in the re-building, and are not now visible.  It is possible, but by no means certain, that this present stone is one of the ones which escaped re-use at that time.  Mr. C. D.

I have been informed that all these three stones were originally placed around a holy well two fields distant from the Pen-Arthur farmhouse.

`Welsh archaeologists will be gratified to learn that these three stones have been rescued from their dangerous situations, where they have been long exposed to injury by passing waggons, etc., and placed for permanent security in the Cathedral of St. David''s by the venerable Dean, by whose noble exertions that splendid edifice has been so admirably restored, and where it is hoped, that other outlying stones from the neighbourhood may gradually be brought together, forming, with others already there, a lapidary museum equal in interest to those of Margam Abbey and Llantwit Major.

`In removing these stones to St. David''s it was discovered that the Gurmarc Stone possessed two features which had not been previously observed. First, that the upper left hand angle of the face of the stone was inscribed with several letters, corresponding with the chirho monogram of Christ on the opposite right angle of the stone; and second, that the reverse side of the stone was also carved with a cruciform design. These peculiarities are represented in the accompanying drawings taken from photographs and rubbings kindly forwarded to me by the Dean.''

The combination of cross and monograms was perhaps intended to symbolize the Crucifixion, and on one stone (No. 411), apparently of related character, the monograms are replaced by the figure of Christ. The type is probably of Irish derivation, though perhaps based ultimately on Merovingian or even Coptic models.[3] The monograms occur also on related slabs of more decorative character (cf. No. 376). The use of the monograms and the presence of the developed wheel-cross form on certain of the plain slabs suggest that the group as a whole is not earlier than the 10th century. The present stone may, however, go back to the 9th century (cf. No. 4-10).

Lhwyd|"Westwood/1865, 60--61, `IN Gibson''s _Camden_ (ii, p. 23), and in Gough''s _Camden_ (ii, p. 502), it is stated that at Panwen Bryddin, in the parish of Langadoc, about six miles above Neath, is the ``Maen dan Lygad yr ych''''; two circular entrenchments, and a stone pillar inscribed MARCI CARITINI FILII BERICII. ...

`In the Ordnance Map we find the encampment on Panwen Bryddin marked as ``Y Gaer''''; but the inscribed pillar no longer stands there, having been removed thence, and carried to Gnoll Castle, overlooking Neath, many years ago; the particulars of which removal, and a subsequent mishap to the stone, are graphically told in the following passages from Mr. Williams'' communication to me:

`The late Lady Mackworth, possessor of the Gnoll, was either making or embellishing a grotto in her grounds. To further her views she had all the curious stones that could be collected brought to this grotto; and this, among many others, was removed from the grave, apparently, of M. Collatinus to this cave, which was to be converted into a grotto; and, being too heavy to be removed entire, was broken. Shortly, after this grotto had been completed, the rock gave way, and the whole structure was buried beneath the ruins ...

` ``[David the under-gardener] described the place to me so precisely and exactly that shortly after I went on a visit to the grotto, and explored and easily detected the spot. I mentioned the circumstance to Mrs. Grant, and begged permission to search for the Gnoll and stone, and also petitioned to have it replaced over his grave, for that was the supposition. The lady kindly promised to put labourers to work immediately; and if the stone should be found, I was to have it to replace on the tumulus by Clwyda''r Banwan. The grotto and stone were found; but ladies having the right to change their opinion, Mrs. Grant requested me to search for the other piece of the stone, and send it to her, as it looked exceedingly well in the grotto ; and there, I believe, it is at the present time'''' (1853).

`The inscribed part of the stone certainly was there when I visited the Gnoll, and found it embedded into the upright bank of a recess, or grotto, in a terrace about one hundred yards to the south of the house, overlooking Neath; but it was then nearly _immersed_ in decayed vegetable rubbish; and as it contains the whole of the inscription recorded by Gibson, I presume that the portion broken off was only the uninscribed base of the pillar.''

Rhys visited the site in 1873 but was unable to find the stone (Rhys/1873, 8).  In 1874 Rhys, with the help of Westwood''s 1865 paper and a workman, rediscovered the stone (Rhys/1874, 332).

Westwood/1879, 6, `The earliest notice of this stone is that given by Edward Lhwyd in Gibson''s Camden, p. 620 (copied in Gough''s Camden, ii. p. 502, and ed. alt. iii. p. 132), where it is stated that `in Panwen Brydhin, in the parish of Llangadoc, about 6 miles above Neath, is the Maen dan Lygad yr ych, two circular intrenchments and a stone pillar, inscribed M. CARITINI FILII BERICII.'' The stone is about a yard long and 8 inches broad. From a letter, with which I was favoured in 1853, by the Rev. T. Williams[1] of Tir-y-Cwm, Ystrad, near Swansea, it appears that about the year 1835 the late Lady Mackworth, then the possessor of The Gnoll, near Neath, collected together all the curious stones found in the neighbourhood for the embellishment of a grotto she was forming in a terrace about one hundred yards to the south of the house, in the ornamental ground overlooking Neath. Being too heavy it was partially broken before removal, the extremity of the inscription receiving some injury. Shortly after the grotto had been completed the rock-work gave way during a heavy storm of lightning and thunder and the whole was buried from sight.

`... Mr. Williams... induced Mrs. Grant, the then occupier of The Gnoll, to have the ruins removed, when the stone reappeared without having suffered any further injury. The place however became neglected, as in 1846 I found the grotto filled with dead leaves and garden rubbish so as nearly to hide the stone again.

`[1] Mr. Williams''s letter appears in extenso in my article on this stone in the Archaeologia Cambrensis, Ser. 3. vol. xi. p. 59.''

The stone is listed by Nash-Williams under `Neath Higher'' (Nash-Williams/1935-36, 169).

Macalister/1945, 378, `Lhuyd in Gibson''s Camden describes this stone as being `at a place called _Panwen Byrdhin_ in the parish of _Kadokston_ or _Lhan Gadok_ about six miles from Neath.''  It was then well known under the name _Maen dau Lygadyr_ (_sic_ read _Lygad yr_) _ych_ `the stone of the two ox-eyes.''  These ox-eyes were ``two small circular entrenchments, like cockpits,'''' of a kind unknown to Lhuyd elsewhere; we need not trouble ourselves with his guess at an explanation of them.

TCSTL|1|recognised|1878|L. Price|"Westwood/1876,  76: `Archaeologists are indebted to the Rev. Lewis Price, Vicar of Llywell, for the discovery and preservation of a very remarkable ornamented stone inscribed with Ogham letters on the edge. In May, 1878, it was standing on the road-side leading from Trecastle to Glasfynydd ready to be used as a gate-post. It was found in a huge heap of stones in the vicinity. The stone has been examined by Mr. G. E. Robinson, one of the Secretaries of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, who forwarded rubbings and notes of it to Professor Rhys, which have been placed by the latter in my hands.''

Robinson/1878, 221--22: `This stone was found some little time ago upon part of the rough land of the farm of Pentre Poeth, in the hamlet of Capel Llanilid, or Crai, near Trecastle, and, if still in the position in which I saw it, is more readily approached from the latter place than any other, and distant from it about a mile and a half...

`At the time of its discovery it was somewhat beneath the surface, and was turned up when the land was prepared for agricultural purposes.  The shape and size of the stone at once commended it to the favourable notice of the farmer as admirably adapted for a gate post, and for this purpose he had it removed and refixed upside down at the entrance of Pentre Poeth farm, where we found it.  The sculptured face attracted the attention of the Rev. Lewis Price, vicar of the adjoining parish of Llywel, at whose earnest persuasion the farmer was induced to postpone his intention respecting it, pending a more accurate examination of the character of the sculpture, and the reading of the Oghams along the edge.  Although part of the sculptured face was buried beneath the surface, sufficient could be seen above ground to indicate the character and importance of this monument, and warrant the efforts made by Mr. Price to preserve it intact; and it is regretted that the offer he then made, of supplying at his own cost a substantial oak post in exchange, was not accepted, as in its present exposed position by the side of a public road it is liable to injury.  Perhaps on more mature consideration, the present possessor may be willing to forego his claim, and ere long let us hope it will be securely fixed in some sheltered spot in the churchyard of the adjoining parish of Llywel, where both the Ogham inscription and the sculptured face may be clearly seen.''

Macalister/1945, 325--26: `This stone was first brought to notice by Rev. Lewis Price, vicar of Llywell ; but its existence must have been known to certain persons previously, as there can be no doubt that it is the monument referred to in a note in AC 1875, p. 193, in which Rhys passes on some heresay information about an inscribed stone at a place called `Y Castell''.  The monument stood on the side of the road from Trecastle to Glasfynydd upon a heap of stones with which it seems at one time to have been covered ; and it was rescued from being converted to a gatepost just in time. Soon afterwards it was transferred to the British Musuem''."|in display|museum|On display in the main galleries of the British Museum.|pilsp|"Robinson/1878, 222: `The stone is an oblong slab, of the old red sandstone series, about 6ft long, averaging 20 ins. in width by 4 ins. in thickness, and appears to have been rubbed or otherwise prepared to received the sculpture.''

The design is quite unlike that of any Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, or Irish stone or MS. with which I am acquainted. In the upper part appears a St. Andrew''s cross with circles, and in the right-hand upper corner is a figure which may be intended either for a bird (owl?) or a man. The other figures are irregular as well as partially defaced, so that I can make out no very decided pattern...

`I must confess, with regard to this last suggestion, that the want of similarity of this ornamentation to any eighth-century work renders its date extremely doubtful; indeed, the irregularity of the design seems to me to be nearer to that of some of the Brittany and other rude Celtic monuments.''

Robinson/1878, 223, provides a discussion of some possible interpretations of the decoration.

Macalister/1945, 326--7: `(1).  On the face which bears the Roman inscription there is a single cup-mark, which has no connexion with any of the other sculptures on the monument.  It appears in the diagram to the right of the L of the Roman inscription.

`(2) ... There is a small cross [FINISH]

(3.) On the opposite face of the stone there is a series of sculpturings, of extraordinary rudeness, in three panels.  These are inverted with respect to the inscriptions, and the blank butts for burial in the ground are at opposite ends of the stone.  Therefore, when the whole inscription was exposed the sculptures were partly buried, and _vice versa_.  It follows that they cannot be contemporary.  When the sculptures are right way up the stone presents an unnatural inverted wedge shape: this possibly, though not conclusively, suggests that the inscriptions are older than the sculptures, and that when the stone was re-adapted for the sculptures it was inverted to shew that the inscriptions had become obsolete...

`As to the meaning of the sculptures, that can be a matter for conjecture only ; and the guesses that have been published...do  not encourage anyone to contribute further to such futilities.  The top panel represents a man carrying a shield (?) and below him a ship [Noah''s arc?].  The second panel represents a man with a cross on each side, passing between two groups of zigzags (water ?) ; below, a serpent (?) [Moses crossing the Red Sea, with a reference to the preliminary miracle of the serpents? ?].  The bottom panel shews a man with a crook; a serpent (?) on the dexter side, on the sinister a series of C''s which may mean anything or nothing : on the dexter side a summary representation of two animals (?) [David with his sheep, as figured on the cross at Penmon, Angelsey ?]  But designs which make so heavy a drain upon the fount of marks of interrogation cannot be made the basis of  any scientifically satisfying speculations !''

Nash-Williams/1950, 81--2: `The small linear-cross clumsily inserted in the centre [of the Latin inscription] may be a later (? 7th-9th century) addition....The stone was subsequently reset in the ground head downwards and the uninscribed face decorated with incised linear symbols or pictographs, grouped in three conjoined vertical panels with incised border-lines: (i) the top panel is divided transversely into two compartments-the upper containing miscellaneous motifs including a small human figure, facing front on r., and cruciform, dotted, and hatched or `pectiform'' devices in the rest of the space ; the lower divided centrally and diagonally into pairs of opposed triangles filled variously with reticulated and scroll-like (? or zoomorphic) forms ; (ii) small human figure running (?) to front, with arms outstretched, between bands of parallel zigzags, with small linear-crosses in the field to 1. and r. and dotted and scroll devices (? representing the ground) below ; (iii) small human figure, facing front, holding a bent staff or crook (?) across the body in the 1. hand and a bag (?) in the r., with pectiform, crescentic, and zigzag devices in the field around. The distinctive style of the decoration is unique among the Welsh Early Christian monuments, and finds its closest analogies in the prehistoric pagan art of the megalithic and later monuments, particularly those of Brittany and the Atlantic sea-board regions, ''with an admixture of later elements (e.g. the human figures) perhaps derived from the unsophisticated popular art that continued to flourish in Gaul and the other Celtic regions under the Roman Empire. If this comparison is valid, the present monument may reflect a backwash of Breton and Gallo-Roman influence into S. Wales, following the large-scale British migrations to Brittany in the 5th and . 6th centuries.1 Alternatively, the art may have been introduced into S. Wales via Ireland by the Ogam-using immigrants. In either case, the re-use of the stone presumably followed at no great interval after its original erection.''"|f|TCSTL/1

Between the extremities of the limbs is a flat fillet in place of the cable moulding, but the latter now only remains on the lower limb of each cross.  Traces of a larger cable moulding on the angles of the shaft are still to be seen here and there.

On 22 October 1804 Bray removed the stone for safety to what was then `the grounds of the Abbey-house, and now within the precincts of the churchyard'.  Subsequently Bray (`On my quitting the Abbey-house for the Vicarage') moved the stone to the vicarage garden and had it set up `near the drawing-room window'.  The stone is still in this position.  This removal probably occured in 1818; Bray became vicar of Tavistock in 1812 and according to Kempe the vicarage was built for him in 1818.  In 1822, Lysons and Lysons recorded the stone `on the site of the abbey', but this probably also refers to the vicarage garden.'|in ground|other|Okasha/1993, 271, `The stone is now in the garden of Tavistock vicarage'.|pilsp|"Macalister/1945, 472, `A granite pillar''.

Shaft: A lion, with projecting tongue and raised tail above its back, proceeds to the left at the bottom of the shaft. Above it, birds with elongated necks have tails which coil into a spiral, where they interlace with a ribbon-bodied animal. The head of one of the birds can clearly be seen to have an ear-lappet. Above the second bird there is another animal with a tail which interlaces in a spiral fashion with the second bird''s neck, and with its head placed in the upper left-hand corner of the panel.
Head: The centre of the head is occupied by a square panel with a two-strand interlace, above which there is a double three-pointed knot of interlace. The south arm bears a lion similar to that on the bottom of the shaft and - like it - also turning towards the left.

SOUTH SIDE (Fig. 71):
S1: A ribbon-bodied animal forming a flat interlace, with its head on top and its fish-like tail below.
S2: A lyre-like design, consisting of a pelta-shaped C-spiral rising upwards to two outward-coiling spirals.
S3: A panel of single-strand loose interlace.
The underside of the ring bears interlace ornament.
End of the arm: The end of the arm bears a panel of two-strand interlace.

WEST FACE (Fig. 72):
W1: Inscription...
W2: Four circular interlacing devices.
W3: A two-strand interlace terminating above in a two bird-heads with interlocking beaks. Between the bird''s necks there is a a raised knot of interlacing with a sunken cross-shape in the centre.
Head: A round knot of interlace is placed in a raised circle at the centre of the head, surruonded by a further circle of single-strand interlacing framed by a further raised circle. The south arm has loose interlace enclosing a round knot of interlace, simialr to that between the bird''s necks on the shaft. The decoration of the north arm is similar, though more worn, while the ornamentation of the top of the cross has been completely obliterated.

Wynne, Esq., during the Meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in that town, who also kindly placed in my hands a series of rubbings of the stone. These materials enabled the Rev. John Williams (Ab Ithel) and myself, after many hours'' labour, to prepare a memoir with figures, which appeared in the Archaeologia Cambrensis, 1850 (pp. 90_100), being also referred to in the Report of the Caernarvon Meeting (Arch.

Below the cross is a plain band formed by two roughly parallel lines about 1 3/4 in. apart.  The cross is 21 3/4 in. high and 11. 3/4 in. wide; it is of Irish type, with straight limbs and rounded `armpits''; the head and foot have splayed terminals.  The whole is outlined by a continuous beaded edge formed by an incised line.  The wheel, of 10 in. external and 7 in. external [sic] diameter, is of similar relief, and also has the moulded edge. ...

`The back of the stone is plain apart from a continuation of the basal band appearing on the face and also the sides.  The latter are both ornamented above this band with an intricate, if uneven, strapwork design in low relief.  On the left side this is apparently derived from six-cord plain Stafford knotwork with cruciform intersections, but on the right side there is a different design in which the Stafford knot is incorporated, but without cruciform intersections.

`The Walton West stone, bearing a fullly-developed Latin wheel cross and monograms seems to be the most chastely-ornamented and well-proportioned representative that has yet come to light of a number of similar examples which appear to be of a local Pembrokeshire type.
